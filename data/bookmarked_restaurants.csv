Sisig usually goes quick so next favorite item would be chicken curry. When I'm in the area and in the mood for Filipino food, this is my go to place."", ""Great spot for lunch! I got this 2 entree plate for ~$7-8. BBQ pork was yummy and I'd definitely order it again. Got the string beans to be a little healthy but it was actually a little oily.

And these combos are packed to the brim with your choice of entree's regularly including lechon, sisig, beef caldereta, bbq pork, bbq chicken, chicken wings, and more. You can also get 3 different sized entree portions (s,m,L) if you don't need the rice/Pancit/etc. I highly recommend the bbq chicken and BBQ pork with fried rice. The fried rice has plenty of garlic which I absolutely love. There's also lumpiaThis place can get a line out the door but since the food is already prepared, it's quick to get in and out.They also have a few Filipino desserts including Toron, banana lumpia.Nanay's is sure to satisfy your palette and keep you full for the afternoon! Enjoy! Salamat Po!"", ""If you're new to Filipino food, i'd recommend getting the BBQ chicken and BBQ pork with the fried rice.I've tried a few other dishes and they tasted very homemade. \xa0It's not a bad thing, i just felt like those dishes were meant for people who grew up with it.The lechon unfortunately was too hard for me. \xa0I felt like i could break a molar trying to eat the lechon here. \xa0Maybe it was a bad day but i haven't had a chance to go back on a thursday.

Honestly, I'm quite surprised that we were able to make it into Yakyudori since they're usually pretty busy. I ended up ordering the Chicken Katsu Bowl which was good. You get pretty big pieces and the breading is very crispy. I've gotten this dish in the past as well and my only issue would be that they sometimes skimp on the mayo. They charge extra if you want more, and given the size of the chicken pieces, it'd be nice if they offered a little more of it since it can get a bit dry in texture without it. I usually don't have this issue when ordering Chicken Katsu or Karaage Dons at other restaurants. During my most recent visit, I also got to try their Pork Shiso and Bacon Wrapped Asparagus Skewers. Both were delicious and cooked nicely. The Pork Shiso definitely has a prominent basil taste so keep that in mind if you're planning on ordering it. I've also tried their Pork Belly and Beef Skewers in past visits which were pretty good as well. For the Beef skewer, it isn't the best quality beef I've tried, but it's always cooked very well. \xa0Overall, Yakyudori isn't my favorite Japanese restaurant in the area, but it is still a solid option.

We also ordered the steak salad which ended up being a few pieces of beef, a thin layer of greens and a heaping portion of just rice.

The chicken had a thin layer of crisp panko breading and was not oily and the meat was not dry. I like how they thinly sliced the green onion (though I am not a fan of raw green onion and did not eat it) -- the sign of a true chef in the kitchen. This was one of the best chicken katsu dons I have ever had. I would definitely recommend it.I was a bit surprised there was only one fried soft shell crab in the order for $7.50 but it is seafood after all so I should have expected it. In contrast to the small amount of crab, there was a large amount of sides (daikon, sauce, lettuce). The crab was crispy and true to the soft shell crab name, it was easy to eat shell and all. It was good but at $7.50, it was a bit pricey for a small snack.The amount of food was more than enough for me but I notice their portions are a bit small. I would suggest ordering a bit more than normal. I am not sure if their portions are small because COVID has hit all the restaurants hard and they have to keep their prices down or if they were always small.I enjoyed my meal and would come back to support them again!', 'Came here with my bf because I was craving takoyaki and San Diego seems to have a shortage of spots for some.

Unfortunately our usual spot is temporarily closed due to covid, so we had to look else where for take out and found yakyudori. Wow blows out our old favorite, will go here from now on. So thankful they're still open for take outs so I can get my Japanese cravings fulfilled during these covid times. The items I ordered:Karage, fried chicken: crispy, tender, delicious. Pork belly skewer: simple, but smoky & delicious. I wanted to try their beef, but my cheap ass didn't want to pay the $7.50 for 2 skewers. Bbq pork bowl: a little sweet, a little savory, with browned & crispy pork pieces, drizzled with corn & Mayo on top, a few shredded cabbage. Loved this. So good. Great portion size! Gyudon beef bowl: the best gyudon I've tried so far in San Diego because of the meat ratio. They are not stingy with the meat like most restaurants are. It's usually a thin layer of meat on top with with a ton of rice in other places I've tried. Not here at yakyudori! They put a ton of the thinly sliced beef, I mean look at my pictures below. Great portion size too, my husband was so full & barely finished it. This will now be our go to when we're craving Japanese. Our new favorite spot. I'm looking forward to trying their ramen next time. My only request if the owner reads this, please add shrimp & veggie tempura to your menu.

The cabbage was flavorless and I never got my side of plantains that each plate supposedly ones with. 2 stars for good costumer service at purchase but everything else is not up to par."", 'This Jamaican eatery was on my list of places to visit when I saw them on a compilation of local Black-owned businesses. Ackee Tree The Real Jamaican Cuisine is located in the College area but several blocks west of the main business district. A couple of tables were set up inside for dining, however the majority of customers were placing take-out orders.The menu had three sections... one each for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I had arrived near the close of their lunch period, and dinner was about to start. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise because the item I wanted was unavailable on the lunch menu. The start of the dinner hours was close enough that the kitchen had already begun preparing it.Specifically, I chose a large serving of the Curry Goat ($13). The included side items were rice, peas, cabbage, and plantains. The goat meat was chopped into small pieces and contained bones so you had to be careful when scooping a bite into your mouth. The curry sauce was savory with blended spices that were not too hot for my palate. The cabbage and plantains were each mild buffers to balance out the seasonings.Their offerings are very comparable to the other Caribbean restaurants in town. The quality and quantity of food I received were sufficient enough to be rated at a four star level.', ""Wow! What a celebration this place is. I drive 30 minutes to get here and it's worth every mile. The classic flavors of their Jamaican cuisine are executed perfectly. My go to is the brown stew chicken and the oxtail combo, although the jerk chicken is fantastic too. The meats are prepared perfectly with moist chicken and expertly executed, tender oxtail, but what really blows my socks off are the flavors of the sauce they're cooked in. You can really tell that a lot of time and care is put in to prepare a delicious meal. Also, I can't get enough of their Jamaican patties and plantains."", 'Open during covid19** Highly recommend getting the deep fried fish, oxtail and side of mac n cheese. The dinner plates already come with rice, plantains and steamed cabbage. We wanted to get jerk chicken but they ran out, so next time! The service was also really friendly! The lady who took our order was such a sweetheart, she made sure we had everything we needed and even offered us water. It was very homey and welcoming. Definitely come here for some finger lickin Jamaican food!', ""Hidden gems, never thought an authentic Jamaican restaurant existed near me, I went right away to order some of the food I've been graving for a long time, although I cut back on the rice, but their green and plantain were amazing, flavorful sauces and pretty filling. Definitely come back."", ""VERY LAZY, with HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Never have any patties available! Been calling for the past 3 MONTHS! Why even have them on the menu if you don't want to cook? Called and ordered 4 chicken patties and was told to come in 1 hour & a half, upon arrival my boyfriend is asked if we would like to purchase them FROZEN TO TAKE HOME AND COOK OURSELVES?! What type of unprofessional establishment would do such a thing? Completely ridiculous and we will NEVER be returning.""]"

I was by myself so I was only able to try the classic chicken pie with mashed potatoes and gravy (little pieces of califlower...yum). \xa0Pie had large pieces of white meat with pearl onions, carrots and peas. \xa0The crust was firm but flakey which is what you need for a savory pie.I hope to go back to try more savory pies. \xa0The dessert pies looked amazing. \xa0They are currently baking a strawberry rhubarb, one of my favorites. They sell frozen pies that can be taken home for future baking, too."", ""I thought I knew what good pie was and was known to speak well of a pie place that shall not be named. I was incorrect. Pop Pie really raised my standards and showed me that said pie place I previously recommended served me inferior pie and that really well-made pie with good ingredients can taste good and look good. They make firm butter crust that holds up when cut while having that essential flakey buttery goodness that good pie crust has. In videos posted, they use good European butter, which is a plus. My personal favorite Pop Pie pie is the key lime pie. It's a classic, decadent key lime pie with a butter crust (the one kind of unique feature) and they are very generous with the whipped cream, which *some* pie places charge extra for. The caramel apple pie is also great and has a crunchy, complex texture with an apple filling that hits that delicate balance between tartness and sweetness. The seasonal fruit pies are all good and manage to avoid the ultimate sin of the slimy, forgettable fruit blend. The current strawberry rhubarb pie is very good. None of the sweet pies are too sweet, and none of them are too sour, again, managing to hit that perfect flavor balance. I rarely find dessert places that succeed in both the sweet and savory department, but Pop Pie delivers. Their vegetarian curry pie is delicious, bursting with complex flavors in every bite. The bake on all of the pies is excellent. They are never burnt or even slightly overdone. They hold their shape in the box, too (a sign of a nicely baked pie).In addition to having unforgettable flavors, I have always experienced great service. The staff actually seems happy to be there (never a requirement by any means, but really nice nevertheless) and I've always felt comfortable asking questions. Overall, Pop Pie is a gem and you should definitely go there and buy some pie."", ""I've had some very good pies from here including Chicken, steak and the Hog & Cheese.I got a Chicken Pie the other day, brought it home and heated it according to instructions and turned it over onto a plate to eat. The bottom of the pie crust was raw. Not just underdone but raw dough. The top of the pie was perfectly browned and golden but the base was completely raw. I had to cut the entire bottom of the pie off and eat it that way.I don't think they blind bake the pies, which would prevent this, or what went wrong."", ""Overall: The location/ambience of the place and the service was amazing. The food was ok (bit dry because they make it in the morning and then reheat it before you eat it), but overall really flavorful and good. +1 StarsQuality of Food: I got several items from their menu. Chicken pot pie - Good. I was surprised they used shallots (or little onion bulbs) but they were all to one side of the pie. I liked the flavor of the pie but I think the chicken chunks were too big and dry. Steak and Ale - Good. Same as the chicken pot pie. Nice flavoring but the meat is a bit dry. Sausage Rolle: Dry and the meat was not very flavorful. Mushroom Quiche: AMAZING!!!! The best quiche I have ever had! The egg was smooth and the crust was flaky! The mushroom and the dried heirloom tomatoes worked well together and it didn't feel like I had to take extra effort to digest that..it melted into egg and meshed impeccably. +0.5 stars Price for Food: For what the food actually is, I think it was a little pricy being 9-10 dollars. However, for the quality and the taste of some of the items, I would say its worth it. \xa0I would say you get your bang for your bucks if you ear it in the location itself. +0.5 starsLocation/Ambience: Honestly, the location was really nice! The side of the wall was open and it let a lot of sunlight in. At first glance, I thought it was a quaint little cafe. The process was also straightforward. You walk in, order the pies, and then exit out another entrance. I also like that it was next to Stella Jean's Ice cream so it was a good place for dessert after (although it looked like they had good desserts too!) +1 starsStaff/Service: The staff was really nice. Even when there was a ton of people out the door, they treated each person with patience and like they were the only ones that didn't exist. +1 stars"", ""What is this place and how do I not know about it sooner!!! TL;DR best customer service and pies in town. Puff pastry is one of my favorite food but I can never find good pairings with it. I came across Pop Pie by chance and now I am coming here almost every single day. They have a wide range of savory and sweet pies, along with delicious handcrafted coffee and tea drinks. Every single staff is like an angel and they treat customers so well that I can't say enough good things about them. Customer service is what sold Pop Pie to me. I would drive out of my neighborhood to Pop Pie so I can avoid the indifferent and unconcerned baristas at starbucks.On my first time visiting, I was being extremely indecisive, the staff at the register walked me through almost the entire menu trying to help me find something I like, and also told me about a semi-secret menu item that you can get half corn and half mashed potato as a side to try more things out. I've since decided I would like to come back to try more. On another visit, Rafael? started making my drink early since there was a small line at the register so I can get my ice cold drink on a hot summer day as soon as possible. Whenever I dine-in, they always double or triple check with me that everything is up to my satisfaction.I also love the food and drinks here. After trying out so many items I've found my likes and dislikes. Taste is very subjective and some of the food I had was not bad, but simply not my palette.Chicken pot pie- Who knew they could tuck huge chunks of chicken into such a small pie, and the pearl onions was a very nice touch to not overwhelm the taste of the herbs.Steak and ale pie- a bit sweet for my liking as a savory pie, and similar to the chicken one, there were big chunks of beef in this one.Aussie pie- my favorite, I don't think you can find this rich flavor profile anywhere else and it is very much like a shepherd's pie. I am yet to try it with ketchup but I will next time.Some of my favorite drinks here include matcha horchata (yay dairy free), jasmine latte, and crystal boba on everything. It is just as good as any other authentic boba shop.I cannot stop thinking about this place and what I would have tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and the day after that..."", 'Been here a few times & I think they are definitely deserving of all the hype. If you are in the mood for a some hearty, tasty comfort type food you should make your way here.Item\'s ordered: The gf & I went with the steak & ale & classic veggie pies with a side of creamed corn to share. All was for takeout. Taste: Neither of the pies were even close to being bad but for these two I just gotta give the win to the veggie pie because it just had more flavor & better seasoning over. I initially thought the steak pie would have more flavor because red meat often lends that ""extra"" flavor that many veggie based dishes are missing. But what I found with the veggie is something I\'ve found with other well made veggie dishes. They really worked to bring out the flavor & maybe added additional seasonings so you wouldn\'t miss the flavor that meat lends. All in all though both pies (even for takeout were so fresh) with a really good flakey crust that\'s just gotta be homemade.The creamed corn had a good flavor but I\'d skip it just because I didn\'t love the texture. The corn was too al dente & needed to be cooked down more while the sauce would work better if it were thicker. Service & parking: They were very friendly which just makes this comfort meal that much more comforting. They do not have a parking lot but it does not seem hard to find a parking close by in the residential area.Protip: You can easily reheat any leftovers in your airfryer especially since they put the pies in aluminum tins.I\'d definitely return here & would most likely try a dessert out since they look delicious.', ""**June 2021 Visit**I was in the mood for dessert and Pop Pie was on my bookmarks, so it was the perfect opportunity to check it off my list! They offer both savory and sweet pies, but I definitely wanted something sweet, though on my next visit I am curious to try one of their personal sized savory pies!After careful consideration my mom and I each decided on the following sweet treats:*Salted Caramel Apple ($6.50): The cashier recommended having it warmed up and honestly, it was a good call. It had a nice comforting grandma made pie essence to it. I would get this again. *Peanut Butter and Jelly ($6.50): I was somewhat surprised that my mom wanted this combination, but if you grew up with this combo you'll definitely love it.They offered both indoor and outdoor seating, and parking is somewhat limited. Though after 6pm street parking is accessible. Enjoy!"", ""The Mother's Day specials were fantastic! We got one of each: lychee rose cheesecake pie, mango passionfruit white chocolate pie, ube coconut hand pie, and strawberry rhubarb hand pie. My favorite was the ube coconut hand pie! The ube filling was a vibrant purple and you get a sweet, creamy filling with coconut shreds. The mango passionfruit pie was also delicious. It reminded me of the drink mango lassi! The lychee rose had a nice balance of different textures with the lychee gelatin layer on top and rose cheesecake on the bottom. You also can't taste the edible flowers haha.Overall, I love this place! Second time coming here. The savory pies are amazing. They're flakey and super satiating! One pie filled me up for two meals."", ""Having tried savory meat pies from another spot in town recently, I decided to visit this shop in University Heights. I have eaten ice cream at the business next door in the past so I don't know why I never bothered to stop by to sample the pies at this place. You still cannot enter the premises as all orders are taken at the service windows and then they call your name when the food has been packaged and ready for pick-up.I already noticed that the prices were more expensive here. My focus was on savory so I bought an Aussie Meat ($9.50), a Steak & Ale ($10), and a Sausage Roll ($5.50). The two pies were served in tins while the roll was placed inside a waxed paper bag along with some dijon mustard packets. The quality of the pastry crust was nice and flaky. The meat fillings were on the dry side though. I do have to say the Sausage Roll was definitely better than the competition.My experience with these products at Pop Pie was on a four star level. There were some gaps in quality and pricing that didn't quite elevate the rating to five stars."", ""Delicious savory pies!I have been wanting to try this place for forever and it did not disappoint! I got the steak and ale pie and was surprised by how good it taste! The other pictures on Yelp make the pie appear huge, (I thought they would be 7 inches in diameter) but they're actually around 5 inches in diameter. It's still pretty big and can definitely be eaten for two meals. The crust is really butter-y and slightly sweet which is a good contrast to the savory filling. The pieces of steak inside the pie were huge! They were 1 in x 1 in x 1in cubes and some were even bigger. My only complaint is that the filling is a little salty and I have been having to sip a lot of water ever since I ate it. The store itself is really cute! It's at a corner in University Heights and is right next to Stella Jean. You order outside and the pie comes out immediately if you don't order any drinks or sides. There is almost always a line but it doesn't take too long. Would definitely go here again to try another savory pie or even a sweet one!""]"

This made it more dense and chewy while keeping the fluffiness and slight buttery flavour of brioche buns. I really liked it.- The tenders were just slightly dry inside.- I didn't find the DEVIL GARLIC too spicy. It had a strong punch of umami. The coating of the tenders stayed crunchy even with the sauce.- Their TOP SECRET sauce reminds me of spicy mayo plus something else that I can't put my finger on."", ""Food:We ordered twenty wings, split between four sauces. The chicken was crunchy, but the batter itself did not have much seasoning. They were on par with other good spots in terms of size and juiciness.

The box came with 4 pieces of wings (Garlicky Soy flavor), fries and rice. The wings were good and had nice flavor to it. I recommend eating the wings asap in order to enjoy them while they're still crispy. Mine was a takeout order but luckily it still had some crunch left even though it was cooked about a half hour prior to consumption.Overall an ok place to get some Korean fried chicken!"", 'Great chicken! I ordered the devil garlic and furigake. Although both had an amazing texture, the devil garlic was my favorite. Currently they have a sign that says that you must order online. However, there were some customers who were able to place their order in-person and pay with a staff member. Pros:- the chicken is fantastic-really quick turnaround. I only waited a few minutes after placing my order online and it was ready-free parking in a lot shared with other businesses Cons:- not a lot of seating options but there were a few tables and chairs outside for customers', 'What we ordered: Wing Box ($) Soy GarlicTaste: the soy garlic wings had a nice crunch and flavor to it.

A little pricey, especially compared to my favorite chicken tender joint, Boss Bird. Calvin\'s is good stuff, just a bit pricey. Gawd I hate Grubhub...', ""Finally a good fried chicken place in La Jolla. This place has really delicious, perfectly crispy wings. My go to order is the combo box with the savory red and soy garlic sauces. The furikake flavor is pretty good as well.They also have very good Jalapeño poppers if you want to add a side. The fries I've had were decent, but nothing special - - although they do go well with their secret sauce."", ""YES!!! Furaido now known as Calvin's Korean Hot Chicken is back! I was thrilled when this place opened up again. I had worried they were going to go in the way of Mess Royale when they were supposed to find a new location for their poutine fries, never opening a new restaurant again.I went hog wild ordering the Mix, all Furaido style as it's my favorite, and my boyfriend ordered Tender Only original and Savory Red. The tenders tended to be fairly dry, but, I find that pretty standard with chicken breast. The crispiness of these wings are my favorite. They're not as thick as Rice Chicken (which I also love), but just as crispy, and a different texture. Korean fried chicken is pretty expensive in general, and Calvin's is no stranger to that.Savory Red is not very spicy. I've had the other flavors before but I don't remember what they tasted like, just that I haven't been disappointed by any of the chicken I have eaten here.I did wish they had the pickled daikon back - I miss that being the standard side dish than the slaw they offered. They are open only for take out or eating outside with two small tables.For those who are looking for the place, there is no signage outside - it is where Musashi used to be. They have the sign Calvins from their window. It is next door to the pho place. I had to park and get out of the car to verify that I wasn't in the wrong complex.Ordering was quick and easy. I do hope when it opens after this COVID period is over they will redo the inside. It's very dark and everything just seemed to be painted black, which was a strange ambiance for fried chicken. But... doesn't matter really, since I'm just here for the chicken :D"", ""Found this place on Yelp when I was looking for fried chicken and it did not disappoint!10 piece wings (Garlicky soy and Devil Garlic) - it was super crispy! The batter is textured so it added more crunch. The chicken were a good size and moist. Garlicky soy was very good and the flavors were well balanced. Devil Garlic was a little bit spicy but I could not taste any garlic. I think if I could taste the garlic, this would easily be my favorite flavor.5 piece tender (Savory red and Satan's kiss) - I'm always hesitant to order tenders because it's white meat so it's usually more dry. However, the tenders were moist! Savory red was not spicy and had a hint of sweetness to it. Satan's kiss had a good kick to it. I wish I tried Pure Evil because Satan's kiss wasn't too spicy.Cajun fries - did not see a lot of Cajun seasoning so it was more plain in appearance and taste. The picture on the square site was seasoned a lot. I got it with the top secret sauce and it seems like a gochujang mayo sauce."", ""This establishment used to be under the name of Furiado in Poway inside Atlas market in the food court. They shut down some time early last year. So excited they found a new home in La Jolla under a new name. This plaza is a bit crammed but it's next door to Pho La Jolla. It's take out only at the moment. We called in our order so it was ready for pick up when we got there. We got the 10 piece wing only box to mix and match with 5 Satan's kiss and 5 garlicky soy. We also got a side of corn edamame and sweet potato fries.Calvin's is our favorite Korean Fried Chicken next to Bonchon is my opinion. The garlicky soy has no heat. Their wings are large and perfectly breaded and fried to perfection. The crispy skin flakes off and flew all over the table after each bite. The satan's kiss is too spicy for me and made my lips and tongue tingle.Next time, I would like to go up on the soy garlic and go down on the satan's kiss. Meaning, try savory red and devil garlic.The wings came with slaw which isn't the traditional cole slaw with the creamy dressing but more like a vinaigrette like Viet papaya salad. I didn't like it at first but after a few bites, it was the perfect combo to the wings. It took off the heat from satan's kiss.The sweet potato fries are crispy fat fries. Reminded me of Rally's fries except these are sweet potato. I tasted toasted sesame peanut sauce with the corn edamame. These two sides a were the best choice.Highly recommend you try out their wings because you won't be disappointed! Also call in your order ahead of time to cut down the wait time.""]"

How do I know? Ask all the Chinese customers that are packed in here! This ain\'t a ""Panda"" place in other words. My wife and I splurged and got the Salt, Pepper with Butter Lobster. This was a fantastically done dish and we saw several other tables ordering this and other lobster dishes (they have about 5 different takes). A lobster chopped up and lightly battered and fried with a lot of diced garlic and jalapeños served over noodles. Yeah you have to work at it still with the shells but dang it was worth it.Another hit was the Two Mushrooms with Silken Tofu. Whatever magic sauce they use on this is pure wizardry! The tofu comes lightly fried and once you bite into the skin the tofu creamy tofu oozes out. We both loved this one.As mentioned this place was pretty busy which impacted service. Our server was very polite and when he saw me taking pictures of the lobster he asked if everything was to my expectations and even proceeded to describe the other lobster dishes should we want to try them on our next visit.

The soup had a really refined broth. We also really liked the other items too especially the eggplant and pork. The fish was nice too, but just a tad too much five spice.

FirstI I misread the menu.I thought the Mongolian Beef $8.99. it turned out to be $18.99. Next, they tacked on an additional buck and a half for steamed rice. I would have been happier if the portion of beef was half the size, AND dinner included fried wontans, soup and an egg roll. The dish was served quickly, and came out hot.

We also got eggplant with XO sauce, fish filet chao zhu style, and a house special noodle type dish (we wanted to have lots of leftovers for the week). The duck came packed with lots of care in several containers. The duck was amazingly still crispy, even after the drive home and sitting a bit while we took care of the baby. There were a good number of buns, sauce, slivered green onion, cucumber, a bunch of lettuce leaves and the filling for the lettuce wraps which was tasty didn't have too much filler. A great deal for under $40. The other dishes were also well packed and hot. The eggplant was tender and the sauce was scrumptious. The noodles had shrimp, chicken, beef, pork, and squid. It was tasty too. The fish was a large portion and good, though not as flavorful as some other versions I've had. We had tons of leftovers and were very pleased. The total bill was around $100 for a ton of food that was all good. Very greasy, but that's pretty normal for that kind of food. Looking forward to lunch tomorrow."", 'This used to be our favorite place. But now, their prices have gone up and quality has gone down. We ordered a shrimp & scallop dish for $25, and it came with 3 shrimps. Food also was not as good as before.', 'My wife had a hankerings for some noodles. Decided to give this place a try again. Ordered a ye mien, beef fung, fish in black sauce, and pepper garlic shrimp. We were happily surprised at the great portion and the tastiness of the food for a reasonable price.

I assumed, it would of been smoother and faster especially they're not busy but they tookLike foreverrrrrrrr...... I got tired waiting, luckily I have cash and pulled out money and left. They then followed me coz I forgot to pay my bill. I told her, I left money at the table. Service is so poor, lousy and so slow. Plus unsanitary. Pls clean your hotpot. I looked at the rest of the customers hot pots and I think mine was the one that had the most molds. I've been going back and forth in the bathroom as soon as we got home.

First timers should go with the OMG - fresh mango, sticky rice, mango pudding, and ice cream - to sample a few of their menu items and once (and the plating is gorgeous haha). We also enjoy the brûlée and rice and MNGO sundae, and get those often. The rice is cooked to sticky and chewy perfection and has that nice non- sweet coconut flavor. The mango is fresh and its sweetness complements the rice. We tried the cheesecake and crepe cake and view those as just okay.The kakigori is something first timers should try too. It's melt in your mouth deliciousness and big enough to share if you want lol. As for drinks, nothing special to their coco drink.Service:Friendly staff. As usual with good spots, there's a line.

The cafe also has nice and airy vibes, which is just great in general. I thought I was going to be getting Japanese desserts (kakigori?) but one taste and it was obviously infused with Vietnamese flavors -- which isn't a bad thing; I was just expecting Japanese. I'm pretty sure the owners are Vietnamese too, because I heard the workers speaking Japanese. I had the Thai tea kakigori and the mango coco drink with milk jelly. The Thai tea kakigori is a Thai tea flavored shaved snow, filled with boba and grass jelly, topped with whipped cream, and comes with a side of condensed milk. The sweetness level was perfect and the portion was very large -- it made two people full. Those of you who are Vietnamese will love the coco drinks. It has that very Vietnamese coconut flavor that you get in chè and stuff like that. Sweet and salty, you know?"", ""If you haven't hit up this place while you were in SD, you're missing out.Best kakigori or possibly mango dessert I've had in my life, no joke. (Would not recommend for those who can't handle very sweet desserts though). They gave so much side sauce (condensed milk & mango puree(?)) that you probably won't use it all but it does make the shaved ice much sweeter. The mango puree was pretty good, reminds me of mango water ice a bit. The stick rice platter was so cute! It came in a mango shaped dish and it was also just as good as the kakigori! Definitely recommend for those who are big fans of sticky rice (and for those with a smaller sweet tooth).Super cute interior design & neon lights!!"", 'MNGO serves a variety of desserts that will suit Asian palates: tropical, fruity flavors that are usually subtle and nuanced instead of being in-your-face. Some of these desserts, like the kakigori - a type of shaved, sweetened ice popular in Japan - also happen to be instaworthy.The MNGO kakigori, for example, was a heap of mango flavored ice that, on the surface, wasn\'t too strongly flavored. Letting it absorb some mango sauce and condensed milk that came on the side allowed it to come to life. Moreover, inside the heap of shaved ice was a decent portion of chopped mango, giving the whole treat a variety of textures and tastes (creamy, sweet, tart) and adding heft to what would otherwise be an easily melt-in-your-mouth, over-all-too-soon dessert.When I stopped by, they had only a skeleton crew working here, so be prepared to wait if it gets busy, as each treat is obviously complex and takes a while to make. There\'s plenty of room to spread out inside, but note that, contrary to past reviews, there are no longer charging outlets on top of the tables, but you can try to sit near a wall outlet.By the way, since this is SoCal, it has to be said: food doesn\'t have to be instaworthy to be satisfying. Fortunately, it manages to be both here. But, yes, folks, try to focus more on the substance than what you think ought to be ""style"" and really isn\'t.', ""Hands down one of my favorite places to come to Convoy for dessert. I've gotten a couple of things for here and I liked all of it. The thing is with other desserts is that they are often too sweet for me. I prefer the sago desserts because I like the soup-y ness of sago with coconut milk. My favorite to get here is Taro sago (except that I'm not always in the mood for a big chunk of taro) and their mango sago. I love the mango ice cream (taste like concentrated mangos) and the mango jelly below that (so silky). I also like the OMG plate with the coconut ice cream \xa0(refreshing) ans the colorful sticky rice. I often spend hours just studying here (free WiFi) and it's also a nice aesthetically pleasing place to study in. For drinks, I get the butterfly tea because they are so nice to look at, and good to drink. This visit, my friend got the matcha and expresso. She said it was good but she was craving more caffeine!"", ""Are you a big fan of mangoes? Well, my family definitely is! My mom found this cute little cafe on Instagram and we decided to give it a try since we've never tried anything like it. I'm so happy we did!We ordered a mango kakigori which is the Japanese version of shaved ice which was $9.55. For the price, the portion size is insane! You can definitely share one kakigori between 2-3 people. The quality of the shaved ice was great with a burst of mango. The concept of the shop is really interesting. They have a ton more of mango flavored desserts. Service was efficient and went fairly fast. The employees are very kind. If you're a mango lover looking for mango heaven, this is the place for you! Definitely give it a try."", ""Been coming here for the last couple of years and it hasn't disappointed yet! If you are mango lover, this is a must try!

The line was at the door when I arrived at 7:20, and by the time I reached the front, it was about 8:03. I received my order about 8:17, but boy was that a long wait. \xa0 By the time i ordered and sat down, the line was literally out the door and out to the parking lot, so I would caution coming on a weekend, because it was just hot, long, and crowded. I felt bad for the workers because it looked like there were only 4-5 employees working hard, but at the same time the cashier would have to clean tables, pick up phone orders, and restock utensil area. The bathroom ran out of toilet paper so make sure you grab napkins in case you run into a busy night like I did.Parking was easy, the atmosphere was crowded and warm... \xa0Because of COVID, they were not serving their items on the cute mango shaped platters, everything was disposable. I ordered the Japanese kakigōri, (snow iced). It does remind me of a combination of the Taiwanese shaved snow and the Korean Bingsoo shaved ice.I prefer eating snow though because the kakigōri can taste pretty dry unless you let it melt a bit or you use your condensed milk carefully. The toppings are under the kakigōri. Overall this can be a nice experience if you wanted to try a cute cafe with a variety of cool sweet desserts that aren't as common to come by here."", 'Went here with my hubby on a weekend and it was very packed, but worth it! We both enjoyed the shaved ice dessert. He loved the tiger and I got the cha mango one. Also ordered the Vietnamese iced coffee and it was strong and delicious.', ""Super cute and tasty dessert cafe in Convoy SD! I'm from OC and this place is really similar to Irvine's Hui Lau Shan cafe since they both specialize in mango desserts. My favorite items on the menu are the Mango Smoothie and the Mango Kakigori. Both items are rich in mango flavor and are well balanced: not too sweet or tart. The Mango Smoothie is perfect if you want something sweet for yourself and the Mango Kakigori is good to share. For the smoothie, I'd recommend getting a large size since the $0.40 price difference is worth the size upgrade.My friends and I also ordered the Thai tea and Green tea Kakigori which were just okay. Unlike the other Kakigori flavors, the mango one comes with mango syrup as well as the condensed milk topping which I really liked since it helped enhance the mango flavor of the shaved iced. The cafe itself is very spacious and clean. Decor and dessert presentation is also very instagram worthy! Definitely check this place out for mango desserts. 5 stars strictly for the Mango items on the menu and overall cafe aesthetic!""]"

This one is a great place to start if you haven't yet.I've had Coop's a few times over the years. I discovered it through an old job I had where we occasionally catered lunch. Coop's was an office favorite. Not friendly at all for our vegetarian pals, but it's literally West Texas BBQ so... sorry? I've gone to Coop's myself a handful of times before Covid, and recently started getting it delivered on Doordash. I gotta caveat this with there's not a lot of Texas BBQ places in San Diego... but I have had good Texas BBQ in Texas. So no, this can't quite replace the real thing, but knowing we got something close is great! I typically get brisket & rib plates. My fave side is the mac and cheese. Oh and make sure you get the collard greens. Just do it.While I love this place overall, this is definitely not *the best* Texas BBQ place in the area (sorry). I mostly knocked off a star because of their funky hours and occasional inconsistency. Still love ya tho coop!"", ""Best BBQ in town, hands down!! \xa0Went there for the first time and haven't stopped dreaming about it since. \xa0Everything we ordered was a 10/10, and what makes Coop's the best is that not only are all the meats perfect but the sides were just as good!Couldn't decide what to get, but another passionate customer in line told us whatever we get won't disappoint. \xa0He was right!We ended up getting a large plate, which comes with two meats and two sides along with cornbread, and an additional meat as well. \xa0We tried the rib tips, brisket, and the pork ribs for our meats. \xa0Everything was flavorful, moist, fell off the bone, and had the right amount of smokiness. \xa0 \xa0The mac and cheese was indulgent, cornbread fluffy yet also packed it in, and the collard greens were surprisingly delicious.You can eat outside by the tables outside Da Chicken Coop (same owner as you'd expect with that name). \xa0Tip: order ahead on the phone and pick up as the wait's about 30 mins after ordering!"", ""First visit!Called in my order as soon as they opened on a weekday.

The restaurant is in a small plaza and shares a parking lot with several other shops. I opted to park along the street.When I returned home, I devoured the brisket and pulled pork! The red beans and rice nicely complimented these slow cooked meats very well. The bread was a bit dry for my tastes. It was ok, but I'm just not a big fan of cornbread or anything like it.I honestly could have used more of their awesome barbecue sauce than was given. I tend to be very liberal when dipping meat so almost any amount is never enough when the food and the sauce are this good.I definitely want to come back again and try a few more items on the menu. Maybe some pie.Check this local joint out if you're in the area for some good barbecue!"", ""If you haven't tried Coops your missing out on good original BBQ.

But today, I've tried for over an hour calling to place an order and letting the phone ring each time for over 3 minutes! \xa0 I'm sorry Mr Coop, but if business is that good - then great for you but I will not be going back there until perhaps Covid-19 is over (and we know that'll be a long time from now) and there are other bbq places to get my fix from."", ""It's rare to find a BBQ place that knows how to do chicken. Most places view chicken as an afterthought and it shows. Coop's does not. My chicken wasn't dry and it tasted soooo good. The brisket was on point. It was fork tender and perfectly seasoned. Oh, and the beef ribs were very tender. I didn't have to gnaw on it to get the meat off and I appreciated that.We ordered macaroni and cheese, potato salad, and greens as sides and they were ok. The greens needed a bit more salt and the macaroni and cheese was very cheesy, but was missing something. The potato salad was ok.All in all, it's definitely in top 5 BBQ spots between SD, OC, and LA.""]"

At my first visit, the line out the door was just short of the corner of Date St and India St. The staff was extremely friendly, and the shop had a very generous policy of unlimited sampling. The latter was what caused the queue to move so slowly as it took time for folks to taste multiple flavors before orders were placed. I selected a scoop of honey lavender and a scoop of sea salt with caramel ribbons in a cup. Most folks chose their ice cream to be served in a homemade waffle cone, but I was worried about the melting if I did not eat fast enough. The ice cream was smooth and creamy, and the lavender flavor really came through. I did feel it was pricey at $4.90 for one scoop at that time. Prepacked pints of certain flavors were available for $10.50 each. They are now priced at $13 apiece. This was good ice cream, but not five star worthy as I have tasted products of equal quality elsewhere in SD without a 45-minute wait.

Perfect way to make time go by faster while you wait for your brunch spot to call (at least that's what we did) The staff is super friendly!!!

I only give a 3 because of the service. I went to Bay Park Fish Company around 6pm on a Thursday evening with just one other person. When we arrived, parking was rather easy - there is street parking in the local neighborhood that is close enough to the restaurant. When we walked up, there were only about 3 groups waiting outside and there were 2 hosts that completely ignored us for a full 5 minutes because they were trying to figure something out. Once they figured it out, one said ""we\'ll be with you in a few minutes"". So then it took even longer to even get our name on the list. They told us it would be a 30 minute wait but then it ended up only being 15 minutes. We were shown to our table but a waiter didn\'t come over for quite some time. Once the waiter did come over, it seemed like we were inconveniencing him by existing. Then it took a significant amount of time for our food and drinks to come out. The drinks are average - they are as you would expect for a local seafood restaurant. Once we got our food, it was great! The shrimp is my favorite. So while the repeated poor customer service threw a bit of a wrench in my Bay Park Fish Company experience, I will say, overall I recommend going if you\'re looking for some good seafood and a laid back / casual environment. Just go at a time you think you can be patient!']"

I went during lunch on a weekday with my sister and we ended up getting the soy sauce fried chicken, gyoza and the tonkatsu ramen with an added egg and corn. Tbh menya has the best ramen in SD. There's so many ramen places popping up but I consistently love the quality and taste here. The noodles are a great texture and everything tastes deliciously fresh. The tonkastu broth is super rich and I love the options to have less salty broth! I also really enjoyed the fried chicken with the sweet soy sauce coating.

My boyfriend and I ate lunch here around 12 during a weekday and there wasn't a wait. I called the restaurant earlier to double-check and the host told me to put my name down on the checklist via yelp and I was seated as soon as I arrived. We ordered the 5pc Negi pon fried chicken for our appetizer. The portion was very generous and the chicken was delicious! It perfectly fried and had a great flavor. In hindsight, we should've ordered a 3pc between the 2 of us because we were so full after lunch. We also ordered the tonkotsu and miso ramen with a seasoned egg and corn. Everything about the ramen was delicious! The noodles, eggs, and chashu were some of the best I've ever had. The service was also quick, friendly, and efficient! I would definitely come back here and try other things on the menu and highly recommend other people to try it when they're in the other."", ""I came here right when the restaurant opened and was seated when my entire party arrived.

I added an egg and butter to enhance the flavors of the ramen, and because I love seasoned eggs!The broth was rich and flavorful, noodles were perfectly cooked, toppings complemented the dish nicely, and cha siu (pork) was soft and tasty!

Check out the neat history of this place on their website!"", ""My friends and I came here last Friday night. We put ourselves on the waitlist at 7 and were 17th in line initially. We got inside around 910, which was after closing but they accommodated us because we were on the waitlist before they closed it. The space is pretty small which I assume is why it took some time for us to be seated because the service itself is fast. They handed each of us a piece of paper to check off what we wanted, which I felt was redundant because the waitress ended up repeating everything we ordered and asked who's was who, and any additional changes. It probably would've been better to just get our orders verbally because thats basically what they did. I just feel like the use of paper unnecessary. On to the food, the ramen was delicious! I love spicy ramen, but I also wanted lots of chashu, so I ordered the chashu bowl and added a ton of chili oil and red pepper. The broth was creamy and flavorful. My bf and I ordered the 5 pc nagoya fried chicken to share and the pieces were bigger than I expected, however I felt like the chicken was over seasoned with salt so I felt like I had to drink some water after every bite. Overall, the service was quick and friendly, and they fulfilled my cravings for delicious ramen!"", ""This place never fails to disappoint! Every time I come here the Ramen is always high quality. I would say this place is 100% worth the price they charge you, considering that it's on par with other ramen in the area."", ""Felt so good to be back at Menya after the covid reopening. Still the best Tonkotsu Ramen in San Diego, and finally got my hands on the braised pork and it's a must get with your order, they sell out within the first 8 people from what I understand so make sure you book a table right when they open at 5pm."", 'Ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and the chicken.

Highly recommend you do that!The place is very small, in a strip mall. The Paiko Tantaman is flavorful, without being spicy. It has a very unique breaded chicken that made my date say things like ""wow"" and ""I\'ve never had chicken like that."" He insisted it tasted like it had some kind of Indian spices. It tasted good to me but not mind blowing. I preferred the Tonkatsu broth, which was just very umami-ful! I gave my date the pork, but he said it was very good. The broth is pork based :/ as a former vegan, the vegan ramen looked good but too boring to order. But it\'s nice that they have that as an option! Overall, my date was over the moon with this place and he loves ramen! For me, it was good-but I\'d probably be just as happy to have the vegan ramen at ob noodlehouse.

We placed our name on a waitlist an hour prior coming in. They notified us again when we are the second priority list. Perfect timing by the time we got there they seated in the middle of the restaurant where you see the entire action. The room is already packed. Love the noise.

I have tried many ramen places in San Diego, Menya Ultra takes the cake for best ramen in San Diego! If you're craving for some awesome ramen - you've found the place. Their ramen flavors are so authentic and the noodles are homemade every single day! Since their restaurant space is very limited, the wait times are usually super long if you're a bigger party. One time, my family of 5 waited for 2 hours long in comparison to my boyfriend and I'd 30 minute wait. The ramen is really that good that the 2 hour wait is worth it!You are able to choose your toppings and any extras you want added. I usually get seaweed, butter, corn, and extra noodles! You place your order on a piece of paper and the servers will collect and deliver your meal. For such a busy place, their service is unbelievable! They work fast and are very efficient.

It's been on my list, but time and Covid made it almost impossible. And at long last...I've tasted and understand what all the hype is about. We checked in on a Sunday at 11:15ish. We were seated within 10 minutes. It's a small dining area so I can see how the wait times can be longer. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with Braized Chashu. 3 slices is an understatement. I received 3 chunks of tender goodness. I have to admit, my ramen was a tad bit salty. Maybe I'll ask for less sodium next time. My wife asked for her Spicy Miso Ramen to have less sodium and under my peer pressure she asked for extra noodles. Hers was very good, I liked the spice in hers. Not too salty but way too much noodles. Not a problem because they do have to go containers. My bad I thought their noodle amount would be less...haha I was wrong. There were plenty of noodles in both our bowls. Don't get me wrong, I still really enjoyed my Tonkotsu Ramen, but I will be asking for the less sodium option next time. We also ordered the edamame and Nagoya Fried Chicken. The edamame was good. Lightly salted, it was a perfect appetizer. They use dark meat for the Nagoya Fried Chicken, which is fine with me because I prefer dark meat. Never dry or overcooked like white meat.

Of course, the more you get the more expensive it gets, but if you're craving pasta, this is the place to go to get your fix.

The garlic knots are fluffy and tender...with a side of marinara most folks could make them a meal by themselves. \xa0 Add pesto to any sauce, it's worth the kick! \xa0I get most of my pasta dishes baked with extra cheese - come here on cheat days or when you need a guilty fix! \xa0Pre-pandemic, the place is cozy enough for a date night, or meet up with special friends. \xa0I love the quality to value ration, this place is in our hall of fame."", ""Get Your Pastalini On!

The employees are very attentive, the price is light on the pocketbook, and it's the only one in San Diego. It's close to Miramar military base so you'll hear the planes rumbling sometimes and don't worry it's in a strip mall, so there's plenty of parking and outdoor seating. \xa0Enjoy.""]"

If you want a recommendation though, I would suggest the Special or anything with sugarcane shrimp."", ""Loved everything . . The #1 was delicious and very filling. Fresh spring rolls I've been wanting for a while and finally treated myself and they were fabulous. \xa0The other snacks were amazing as well. \xa0I highly recommend this GEM and the price was very reasonable. \xa0AllOf the sauces included were superbly yummy. Thankful I decided to venture out, my wallet and stomach are Overjoyed. The customer service was also great. See you soon, oh yes I will be back for more yumminess."", ""Fantastic authentic Vietnamese restaurant. One thing that I love is they also offer interesting twists on authentic food, like the crepe rolls - so clever!! I love the salad bowls and the goi cuon. The salad bowls are huge with lots of fresh vegetables, which is a nice change from the Vietnamese restaurants that fill the bowls with mostly noodles. The crispy tofu here is also awesome. Highly recommend:- goi cuon with avocado (shrimp and avocado spring rolls)- vegan soup- salad bowl with crispy tofu (I'm sure any protein would be good)- coffee with coconut- crepe rolls- egg rollsHonestly I haven't had anything I dislike. The food here is shockingly better than my Vietnamese grandmother-in-law's cooking."", ""The food is super flavorful, the service is friendly, and the prices are fair. Really can't go wrong!On our first visit, we ordered two of their Grilled Pork Bánh mì ($6.75 each) and two orders of their pork eggrolls ($2.99 each) to go. We don't really have a whole lot of exposure to Bánh mì, other than what we get from Lee's Sandwiches and the taster options we get at random food festivals.But, even though we're not Bánh mì experts, we know what we like and we know what tastes good. And the pork Bánh mì and eggrolls we got from Goi Cuon? We like. So much so that we went back the next week for more eggrolls and to sample the Bánh mì varieties. (Second Bánh mì stint was one \xa0beef and one chicken.)The Bánh mì were bursting with flavor, juicy from the meats and veggies, crunchy from the crispy bread. After having sampled 3 of their meat options, I would rank them as pork, chicken then beef. Each of the sandwiches offered a good texture from the protein, and a nice brightness from the fresh vegetables. And according to my husband, the pork eggrolls are some of the best in San Diego. He couldn't stop talking about how good they were - crispy and steamy, full of lots of good flavors and foods. I actually had to slap his hand away as he was making a grab for my eggrolls!I'm glad Goi Cuon is in our neighborhood, and look forward to sampling the other items on their pretty large menu in the future."", ""Grabbed a couple of combo meals from here for dinner one night, and it was so much fun! Each one comes with soup, cold tea, two rolls (fresh spring roll, pho roll, and/or crepe roll), and three little fried things (eggroll, fried tofu, and/or dumpling), and three different sauces. It's such a fun way to try a bunch of different items and eat a whole selection of things, even if you're dining alone. Plus, two of the four combo options are vegan, which means the non-meat eaters are still included. And double plus, they're only $10 each, which feels like a very good deal.I have to admit that if I just bought a few rolls, my rating would have been lower. My rolls were a bit bland on their own. But the sauces were flavorful and interesting, and made up for it. Plus, the variety makes it all more fun. Like I said, seven things for just $10! I got the #4 combo this time, and I'm looking forward to trying the #3 next time. Will definitely be back!"", ""Our friends recommended this place so we had to check it out! We ordered two banh mi and two summer rolls. For the price of the summer rolls, we expected more than one per order. We overheard other customers saying the same thing. The rolls were tasty and the sauce that comes with it makes the rolls even tastier! \xa0The banh mi was good, too. The bread was crunchy and soft and required only a little neck pull when biting into it. I've had banh mi elsewhere and the bread is super crusty on the outside where I have to unhinge my jaw to eat it. They have indoor seating and water that you could help yourself to. Our friends have great taste! \xa0We will be back!"", ""If you are looking for a refreshing, light (yet-filling) meal then this is your place! My favorite is the #2 combo because it comes with a pork spring roll, beef pho roll, gyoza, fried tofu, soup, and tea. I have also tried combo #1, but I didn't like the crispy stuff in the roll as much. Parking: small lotWait: none. You can also call to place an order for takeout. (~10 minutes to prepare your food)I love this place because of the price, quantity, variety, filling, and light feeling I have after eating. Their variety of sauces - peanut, coconut, and sweet and sour - give every bite a new flavor, so I never get bored!"", ""If I could give this more stars, I would. First of all, the rolls are so big?!? They're like $3-$4 each which is super cheap given how big they are. My boyfriend and I ordered 8 to share, thinking they were going to be your standard sized rolls but these were hefty. We only made it through half. They were sooooooooOooo delicious. The products all tasted so fresh, even the shrimp. They were crunchy. The peanut sauce was amazing too. They add a dab of sriracha to it which really made a difference. They were generous with the peanut sauce. The interior design is really cute. They have a lot of plants and lights. It was very clean and the employees were so pleasant. I wish they were available in LA. Will definitely be coming back when I am in the area.(Good amount of parking available as well)"", 'Love love love everything at Goi Cuon. I was so skeptical of this place because I grew up with viet food my whole life and this place is located in gentrified Hillcrest! Glad we gave it a try!My gf and I loved all the rolls. My personal favorite was the Vietnamese crepe roll with the coconut sauce (comes with it). The pho roll was interesting, very thiccc and filling. Love the basil touch.We ordered the combo #1 ($9.99) and combo number 2, which comes with everything listed on the menu. So filling! I would recommend ordering both combos if it is your first time, or feel free to order a la carte!Parking can be a pain during peak hours but doable: small lot shared with other businesses.Would definitely come back for lunch!', ""Definitely 5 stars. The taste is exceptional. Vegan pho and crepe rolls hit the spot. I'll definitely be back again and again.The price is also 5-stars. One of the best priced places I've found no cap. I'm always concerned about parking in this area, but this place has a parking lot which is cool!""]"

The cabbage salad was awesome, finely sliced and nice and crunchy.Staff was nice and friendly and kept checking up on us which was nice.Their bbq sauce dip is great, worked really well with the pork cutlet. It came with some mustard paste that get it some nice heat if you wanted it. I ordered a combo which came with rice and miso soup.

The pork tasted crispy on the outside but it was a little dry inside and needed the sauce for more flavor.The side dishes, however, were surprisingly the highlight of my meal! I got the agedashi tofu and the raw octopus with chopped wasabi. The tofu was very airy, crisp, and paired well with the broth. It was my first time having raw octopus but it was not tough as I thought it would be. The salt from the wasabi highlighted the octopus flavor and was nice to eat with a fried dish.I definitely would be giving this place another try and to order some different items during my next visit.', 'First time here and the food was so great.

The Seared Beef Tongue was also great and so tender, love the onion sauce, 10/10. Got the katsu curry, the pork loin was so crisp and fresh and cooked to perfection, curry was also delicious, 9/10.

The dashi broth was so good!Squid karaage - super crispy! Paired well with lemon and kewpie mayo.Katsu Curry - the katsu was crispy and tender.

I have tried:- Katsu Curry: *MY FAV THING* This is a MUST order when coming here! The curry is sooo flavorful, has a little hint of spice which is perfect with the crispy loin katsu. \xa0- Loin Katsu: perfectly crispy, flakey and juicy/tender on the inside! Definitely the best I have had - Chicken Karaage: just like the loin katsu, this was also crispy on the outside, and perfectly juicy on the inside! Customer service is OUTSTANDING. Don't get me wrong, I would still come here if the service was horrible since the food is so good, but them having the most amazing customer service just puts it over the top!

The oysters were plump, sweet and juicy. \xa0The black pork fillet's were still moist and crunchy to the bite for the Sando's and the Katsu Curry was just as delicious! \xa0Nothing felt overly greasy or oily to the bite and the curry had the right amount of kick to it. \xa0Can't wait to come back here and try the Izakaya dinner menu!!""]"

I\'m talking about restaurants that specifically special in fish n chips. I have lived here my whole life and I cannot rave about this place enough. The ironic thing, about this place, even though it\'s called ""Fancy Fish"" I wouldn\'t say their food is ""fancy"". All their food is straight to the point without extra add-ins or garnish. I actually love that. They pride themselves on serving fish with flavor! They provide truly good portions for the $$. In fact, I would say you could almost feed 2 smaller eaters with one plate of $7!!! Such a hidden gem, located next to one of the busiest Asian Grocery stores ever but if you get a chance, stop by.', 'Due to having a lot of dietary restrictions the way the menu is set up is perfect and there were way more options for things I could eat than I imagined. \xa0Their grilled white fish with the Cajun rub was amazing. \xa0The fish was cooked perfectly and you get such a generous serving of food. \xa0The staff is extremely friendly and courteous and maintains a clean environment.', ""Wow I haven't been here in exactly a year but the cashier Still remembers me and that I always get hot sauce With my order. That's good customer service.They're offering Apple Pay which is nice especially with covid going on.I ordered my usual tilapia with Cajun seasoning tempura style, with Cole slaw and French fries. It doesn't get any better than this tbh. All that for $10 like what a steal. I also gotta get tartar sauce and hot sauce on the side always. Hot sauce to pour on my fish and tartar sauce to dip my fries in. The fish when it's tempura style is hella crispy which I love And their fries are crispy too. Their Cole slaw just has the right amount of mayo on them which is awesome. They have hand sanitizer at the register (really big Costco sized containers of them) which is good. And I feel like they have good safety precautions in place by keeping the front door open to allow for ventilation and minimal contact with the door.

Let us order our chicken to go but waited to cook it until we were almost done eating so it was fresh when we left. \xa0I'm not a photographer so don't judge based on the photos lol. The food is delicious and fresh."", ""The Fancy Fish has evolved over the years since they first debuted right next door to H Mart in Mira Mesa. The business name originally made me think of different ways the kitchen could prepare, cook, and serve fish. Instead, the menu had a focus on a variety of Asian style tapas with the highlight being their baos. The soft shell crab bao was the variety I picked on my first visit. They put an entire deep-fried soft shell crab in between the dough to make it look intimidating. The taste was pretty good though.On a more recent stop here, it does appear that the cooks have expanded their repertoire. There were numerous styles of Asian prepared fish on the menu with a photo for each item. The fried seafood fare seemed to be highlighted more too with a giant Fish 'N Chips banner hanging in front of the suite. I ordered a variation of that by opting for the Shrimp, Fish 'N Chips platter. There were about half a dozen shrimp and a large whitefish fillet in this combo. Both were nicely fried, however the number of french fries included was rather skimpy. The creamy cole slaw was decent.The prices were good, and I noticed they had a dozen available sauces to choose from. The preparation time was on the slow side as it took about 20 minutes from when I ordered to when I received my food. I do appreciate that the kitchen was making everything fresh though. Overall, I gave a 3.5 star rating for my experiences at The Fancy Fish."", 'Dried mahi-mahi. \xa0Literally jerky! \xa0Soft shell crab over salted. \xa0Cmon guys, what a miss.', 'Friendly staff. Fish and shrimp taste good, fish could be a lot thicker it so thin compre to other places i ate fish and chips. Coleslaw bland needs more mayonaise. Price is good for the items on the plate. Would recommend to other people and friends', ""I was a little underwhelmed. The service was excellent. The food quality was fine. I was a bit disappointed in the size and quantity of shrimp. The fish, shrimp, and chips combo was a dollar more than the shrimp and chips combo. So maybe they don't give you much or bigger portions for a mere dollar extra. At least the fish was big. i was also hoping for beer batter fish. The batter was crispy but bland. I'm not a fan of cole slaw either. But it wasn't too goopy or runny - which is good. Overall decent, but not amazing, food.""]"

The mac and cheese was full of flavor and the best part of our meal but was heavily salted. The beans were overly sweet and as thick as concrete.

The sides - collard greens were just perfectly seasoned and tender. The mac n cheese were the kids fave! Cheesy and flavorful! The Southern style baked beans with bacon is party in my mouth.

I had first noticed them this spring on a list of Black-owned businesses. They have been on my checklist since then because of my affinity for barbecue.

A few tables were set up outside on the sidewalk for on-site dining.The menu had plenty of meats, fried seafood, and soul fare. I asked the cashier if anything was sold out for the day. His response was the chittlins which made me chuckle because that is one Southern delicacy that I will not touch, let alone taste. With so much to choose from, I selected the Sampler Platter (four meats, four sides) to maximize the variety at the best price ($30).These were my choices which left no room to order any of the pies or cobbler. :(* Alabama Chicken Wings* Clara's BBQ Beef Brisket* Hot Link Sausage Andouille* Smoked Tri-Tip* Candied Yams* Cornbread Muffins* Red Beans with Rice* Southern Style Baked Beans with BaconThe chicken wings were the underrated protein of the bunch. The breading was coated to the right thickness and gave a nice crisp. The sweet barbecue sauce was a perfect dip for the brisket and tri-tip. I didn't detect much smokiness in those two meats though. The yams served as the de facto dessert given their sweetness as a finisher to the meal. Six small muffins were given so there wasn't a shortage of cornbread.Their distant location will probably prevent me from returning any time soon, but I was happy to be able to finally patronize this place. The food quality and variety were sufficient to earn a four star rating.""]"

The only reason I stopped coming was because me and my friends kept trying out diff sushi restaurants and I ended up getting food poisoning from one (Never got food poisoning from this restaurant!!h and didn't eat sushi for a good 2 years after that because I was just traumatized LOOOL). When you walk in they have the menu (which has significantly changed from when I last went so I posted photos of the sushi section at least) laid out on a tables blockading the dining area to keep themselves safe. And then there is some hand sanitizer to use once you are done using the menus. I got 3 rolls. Final fantasy, hungry roll, and the spider man 4. The rolls were good but I think I've just outgrown that style of sushi. But it's still good stuff. My mom really enjoyed it a lot and she's picky with her sushi so that says something! Since there was only take out available due to the pandemic, I sat in my car and waited for the sushi. The chef ended up bringing out the sushi to my car which was an unexpected gesture but well appreciated! Thank you sushi chef for doing that!! Overall it didn't take long to get 3 sushi rolls, they were good quality, and they seem to be taking precautions for the coronavirus seriously."", 'We absolutely love this place! They have generous portion of fish in all of their rolls and sashimi. Stephen is a wonderful host and will often hook us up with real wasabi to take home and an extra beer here and there!

I frequently order takeout during these times and when I order via phone, the other employee apologizes that the item is unavailable.

Especially since we all only tried two of the over fifty homemade \xa0flavors offered at once! The flavors may seem basic in name, but the taste and texture are prominent and creamy, respectively. They offer single, double, and a flight of scoops, cups and cones. Also, they have sooo many toppings to choose from; we didn't opt for any as the ice cream was already sweet on their own, and there was already a crunchy texture from the cookies in the ice cream.Service:Friendly and welcoming staff. Not much to say, as we were in and out of the line. But expect a wait at times. Spend that time reading through their extensive menu posted on the wall haha.Atmosphere:A few tables outside to enjoy the ice cream before it melts under the San Diego sun. But also located near the coast, so you can also enjoy it at the beach. Clean and simple decor style the parlor nicely."", ""San Diego's locally owned and operated ice cream parlor is arguably Encinitas' best ice cream in town. Formerly Handel's Homemade. Different name but reportedly same ownership. Up to 60 homemade flavors prepared daily.I sampled many and ordered pints of all of them. The flavor choices included Blueberry Cobbler, Banana Cream Pie, Mango, Pistachio and Red Sky. All recommended. Mango is a good option if you are looking for something dairy-free. Red Sky is a popular kids' choice. It reminds me of a raspberry slushy. Want something more original? I ordered a scoop of the Strawberry. It tasted homemade all right, not too rich or heavily sweetened. By the way, one serving of ice cream means you are getting three hefty scoops on a cone or a cup! They are extremely generous! And service is very \xa0warm and friendly. Kudos to Ian for taking the time to help me and exercise a lot of patience while putting up with my indecisiveness. A plethora of flavors, and some really good ones too. A great spot for the lactose intolerant like me.

I have been here 2x in the past 30 days and this is arguably one of the best ice creams in San Diego. Previous location was Handel's which had insane lines but decent ice cream. This place has shorter lines and, in my opinion, ice cream that kicks butt! Amazing flavors, creamy. My favorite is a black and white milkshake but with more vanilla and extra thick; out of 10 tries, most places get it right (the way I want it) 2-3 times. This place is 2 for 2! Love it, give it a try, worth every penny!"", ""Favorite ice cream place in SD, comparable to MooTime Creamery in Coronado. My family and I drive to this location every Sunday for Sunday ice cream treats all the way from Coronado... Yes it's that good. Although we just recently learned that they hAve a downtown location. This creamery has over 50+ flavors with specials on a daily basis. So far banana cream pie and the tried and true chocolate chip cookie dough are my favorites topped off with their hot fudge. And they are not stingy with their hot fudge either! They douse your order with tons of it. The scoops are big portions as well. So I always get 2 scoops so that I can try 2 different flavors each time.My husband favors the mint choc chip and my son loves their sorbets with sprinkles. One scoop is plenty for the lil kiddos. Give them a try and you will thank yourself!"", ""We cannot rave about this place enough! They literally have over 50 amazing flavors to choose from -- we have never had a flavor we didn't love (our favorites are Cotton Candy Fizz and Cookie Monster). They have two locations, one in downtown SD and one in Encinitas. If you haven't been, do your tastebuds a flavor and go!"", ""I LOVE ICE CREAM!! \xa0This location in Encinitas, CA used to be part of the Handel's Homemade Ice Cream franchise. \xa0It looks like around mid-July 2020, they separated and became Cali Cream Homemade Ice Cream. \xa0According to their website, there is another location in Gaslamp area of San Diego, CA.They have a ton of different flavors on the menu. \xa0It's a little overwhelming, but I visited in December 2020 and decided to try a few flavors (in a waffle bowl). \xa0(1) Oreo and Dough(2) Egg Nog(3) Pumpkin CheesecakeNOM NOM NOM NOM NOM!! \xa0That's all I can say!! \xa0YUM!!"", ""I've been going here for about 3 years now the line is always long even in winter. I had friends visiting from the east coast and I took them to get ice cream and they loved! They only spent a weekend here but they loved the ice cream so they wanted it every day of their trip. I'm not sure why they changed their name from Handel's to Cali Cream but the ice cream is the same. I recently took my dog to this location and they didn't have frosty paws but they gave her a complimentary mini puppy ice cream cone with sugar free vanilla ice cream. My dog LOVED it! I think the Carlsbad line moves a little faster in my opinion. The staff is always upbeat, friendly and pleasant. When I can't decide on a flavor they are pretty good about giving good recommendations especially when due to COVID they weren't giving out samples. My boyfriends favorite is the salted caramel truffleAlso the serving size is HUGE. We got a one scoop and it was enough to share.""]"

Beef is good. Bean sprouts are great in teppan as well.Dessert display was beautiful with a good variety of sliced cakes. My favorite was the spongy chocolate cake. The chocolate mousse cake was too thick but that's ok because....GELATO BAR!!! GELATO BAR!!! I miss these ever since we stopped going to Vegas. For me this was my favorite part. We tried. A lot of flavors and we kept going back for more and more. The sorbet flavors we tried were all amazing. I highly recommend the combo of pineapple sorbet with coconut gelato. Also recommended are the grapefruit, mango, blood orange, and green tea. The one that did not meet expectations was surprisingly the chocolate gelato.THE BAD:Sushi rice was terrible. It was hard and I had to claw it off all my otherwise beautiful rolls. Sushi was otherwise decent but not where we focused. Chinese cold cuts looked great but didn't taste as good.The table, the seat, and especially the feet of the table were sticky. My feet were constantly stuck to the table feet.The cocktail sauce was some weird rendition of ketchup. We asked for some raw horseradish to mix in and cover it up. It's hard to eat good seafood with bad cocktail sauce.SERVICE:Incredibly welcoming and stellar service. There's one guy policing so that people are properly wearing masks and using gloves at the bars which I really appreciate. Only downer was the gelato guy couldn't crack a smile or any other emotion.THE SPACE:Beautiful restaurant! From the second we walked in I was blown away by how much effort was put into the design of an AYCE buffet."", ""I would have given this place a ZERO star if I can. I hated doing this but I had to do it this time so people would avoid this place. It does NOT worth the $31.99 at all. You would be better off spending that amount of money at a Panda express than at 100s. I'm not a big fan of Panda Express but at least I know I'd come out happy and satisfied with Panda Express.I was in town for vacation and excited to try this place out after seeing the good rating and positive reviews. I saw all the Covid precautious policies, I felt comfortable dinning there. COVID precautions: I came here on a Thursday night. I got seated immediately. There were signs saying you have to wear both gloves and masks when getting food from the stations. There were boxes of gloves by the food stations. However, the policy was NOT being reinforced. I saw several people coming up to get food without masks. Staff passed by, saw that and did NOTHING. I felt super uncomfortable after seeing that. I know it's my choice dinning out during this pandemic. My thing is, if you have that policy, follow it. I would not have come if I didn't see that this place had that masks and gloves on policy. Food: this is so-call a seafood buffet. The snow crab legs were the only item probably worth spending that $31.99 here. The snow crab legs were all thin and soaked with salt water. I'm a crab person but I couldn't even finish one leg. The cocktails shrimps were straight out from the freezer and did not defrosted probably. There were no lobsters, not much seafood selection. The hot Chinese food selections were better but the quality was bad. The deep fried items were just full of batter (the meat/seafood was tiny), no flavor. $31.99 for that quality of food? Nah... the cafeteria food at my university did a better job than that but costs less. The MAIN issue was my partner and I got SICK after dinning there that night. We felt so uncomfortable and horrible in the middle of the night. It ruined part of our vacation time because of that. I don't know why this place has 4 stars. I will say AVOID this place. I will never come back. We were pissed spending money there for nothing but sickness."", ""This place is huge, a lot of seating inside. (Hung parking lot outside too)Maybe because of the pandemic, there's one food station empty. Great selections for sushi and ice cream. They have many waiters and the services were pretty good. However, the reason I only give 3 stars is because their plates were not clean. Every time I went to grab new plate, I need to double check and pick a plate that's clean. I'm not sure how they wash the plants, machine or hand wash? I saw so many plants were not clean."", 'I haven\'t been to this place since it was still ""Todai."" Honestly, not much has changed. I\'d say the only thing that changed was the service. Majority of the employees were rude. Food was still decent. I usually stick to crab legs when I go to seafood buffets, but theirs wasn\'t that great. The Crawfish was really good. My brother said it had too much black pepper for his liking. Their Sushi section was pretty fresh. But out of all of the food my favorite that I kept coming back for was those little cheese balls that they serve at Brazilian Steakhouses. SO GOOD! They also have a good selection of ice cream.', ""This used to be one of my favorite, if not my favorite, buffets in San Diego. \xa0Now that they have reopened, it has gone downhill big time. \xa0First off, they pack everyone in like sardines. \xa0It's more packed now than before this stupid pandemic. It's so crowded, a family from the table next to us stole one of our chairs when we went to grab food. \xa0I came back and got the chair back (I was ready to punch someone in their throat) but it shouldn't be so packed, that people are having to steal chairs from other tables when they get up for food.The food lines are ridiculous.

They even ran out of plates several times while we were there. \xa0 You'd think they'd realize that of they're running out of plates, there are too many damn people in there at once. Either that, or they need to hire some more dishwashers. The service is subpar. \xa0The restrooms are filthy and the tables are sticky. \xa0It used to be a somewhat upscale buffet. Now it's like a roach infested cheap buffet. \xa0We had to keep flagging down the waitress for water and napkins. \xa0If not, she would have never come to the table on her own. The quality of the food has deteriorated as well. \xa0I guess they're churning out so much food, they don't have time to make quality food. \xa0Everything is just drenched in sauce and there's really no taste to the food. The only decent thing was the sushi, yet 75% of the selections were empty. \xa0They'd put a new roll out and it would be gone within seconds. Again, if there weren't so many damn people crammed inside at once, you might be able to have an adequate supply of food for everyone in the restaurant.I used to really like this place but it really isn't worth it anymore.

I started using this service because honestly it was a bit scary & stressful in the beginning of the pandemic going grocery shopping when not much was known about the virus yet, so this was a means of me being able to get fresh produce without having to worry about the stress of going to the store. Alas, mask & social distancing mandates have been lifted but I still find this to be an extremely convenient service because technically I am have local farmers grocery shop for me and get their produce delivered straight to my front door. I've tried both the regular & jumbo boxes which are pretty affordable ($25/$35 respectively). I like to order the jumbo box when my sister is in town bcuz she's vegan and it contains nearly twice the amount of produce of the regular box for only $10 more. Otherwise when she isn't in town, I stick to the regularly sized boxes.  Each season has it's diff produce and add-ons which is exciting. During the summer I've been getting A LOT of corn that has been very sweet and delicious and during the winter time I got varieties of squashes. I've also added-on berries to my summer boxes which have been large, juicy, and very sweet. Honestly one of my favorite things about this entire service is not paying delivery fees. If you know me, I freakin hate paying delivery fees, they're just so annoying. So not having to pay extra fees and getting free delivery straight to my doorstep is a big perk for me. \xa0Overall the CSA box is pretty good if you're looking to save time grocery shopping and get seasonal produce."", ""My friend told me strawberries from Yasukochi Farm are delicious. I got them delivered today. They're so juicy and sweet! The ones I got from grocery stores always have a rubbery texture in my mouth. The strawberries from here are nothing like those. Of course they cost a bit more, but I'm very happy with the purchase!"", ""It's been several months that we order weekly CSA delivery box plus a bouquet due to Covid. \xa0The CSA box is at an unbeatable price for the massive quantity though the quality is not necessarily consistent. \xa0So far my experience is hit or miss. \xa0When I am in their AM delivery group, the quality tends to be good. \xa0If I am in the PM group, The box is very sad like: already brown unrecoverable Basil and cilantro, spongy skin and yellowed inside cucumber, already dry asparagus and near opened-up artichoke, partially melty paprika, brown spotted or micro mini citrus as well as nearly a half of near-dead flowers with mostly filler green tree left out of 2 Bouquets ordered. \xa0last week, lots of lots of things in the delivery had to go directly to the garbage bin. \xa0To their defense I admit that I am too picky to play gamble on CSA. \xa0In fact I am very stressed out of this unreliable system of CSA. \xa0Hope Covid is over soon so I don't have to rely on somebody else selecting my fresh produce."", ""Nothing compares to Yasukochi Farms CSA produce boxes. The flavor of farm-to-table food stands out. Everything is fresh cut; no dried-up brown stems here. It's all local and I get whatever is growing fresh now, so no concerns of what country my food came from, or what was sprayed on it to keep it from rotting while it was being trucked from thousands of miles away. Best of all, you can add on some items, like extra berries, eggs, oranges. \xa0Also, they deliver weekly, so I don't need to go out. I do one box every other week, and you can setup that delivery schedule on their website, although I had to reach out to them for help in doing that."", 'The best part about receiving gifts is that very first initial excitement once you open up the package et voila! \xa0You receive exactly what you wanted!That\'s what it felt like to get my Yasukochi Family Farms Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) box!!I was expecting the package, so seeing it there in front of my door I couldn\'t wait to open it up!Yasukochi Farms did not disappoint!My box was packed with fresh veggies and fruits. \xa0Not only did the produce look generously-sized, colorful and fresh, it tasted so :) . \xa0I love how there is a range of produce in each box, which is ideal for me, since I don\'t typically buy large portions of any one veggie or fruit, but like variety in my selections. \xa0Quality and variety over any single quantity I say!I especially love broccoli and cauliflower, which I use to meal prep salads, and Yasukochi provided!!Produce is locally sourced in California from Oceanside, so by purchasing Yasukochi farms CSA boxes you are supporting your local farming community. \xa0It\'s win-win.Yasukochi Family Farms is indeed a family business, with Taisuke and Fred Yasukochi at the helm, proclaiming: Yasukochi Family Farms - ""From our family to yours"". \xa0You can order online, and they even provide recipes on their website!! \xa0I loved the whole package!!', ""I order CSA for only$25 and it's free and straight to your doorstep!

Not lying, but until now the flower are still alive! If I get it any other place it could have died 4-5 days after the purchase.You can add on eggs, honey, olives oil, extra strawberry/raspberry/blueberries."", ""My friend recommended this produce delivery service to me and I'm so happy with it! I tried a few of their regular ($25) and one large ($35) box this past week. A regular box is supposed to feed a family of 2, but they are very generous with their boxes! I get excited whenever my box arrives on my doorstop. I have received farm fresh eggs, tomatoes, watermelon, cantaloupe, strawberries, garlic, onions, potatoes, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, carrots, kale, snap peas, apple, peaches, and so much more! \xa0You can even opt for add-ons like berries or corn for an extra cost. The CSA boxes are a great way to develop healthier eating habits while supporting your local community farmers. I thoroughly enjoyed getting freshly picked delicious fruits and vegetables each week. It has saved me a lot of time from going to the grocery store as well."", 'CSA stands for Community Supported Agriculture. You pay a set price for an assortment of produce from local farms. I encourage you to start eating healthier, and Yasukochi Family Farms will help you do it.When we lived in Costa Mesa, we supported another CSA for a while, but we lost interest. It didn\'t seem like a great value and they threw in some items that were obviously not grown locally, like kiwi.

Nearly everyone can use more veggies. The problem: Making veggies tasty and easy to eat. CSAs are a great way to take the guesswork out of getting a variety of fresh veggies. CSAs can be intimidating sometimes because they present us with veggies that we aren't used to eating or preparing, and many of them can be cost-prohibitive. The solution: Yasukochi Family Farms, paired with a good veggie cookbook (I've used Farmer John's cookbook, and Vegetables Every Day). For $25, you can get a regular farm box full of fresh-picked fruits and veggies delivered to your doorstep. I've participated in many CSAs, and this is the best value and quality by far!"", ""Love it! They delivery farm fresh produce to your home once a week. Love getting these boxes. Every time is a mystery but helps my family eat lots of fruits and veggies. Lots of add on like jam, eggs and flowers. Amazing and delicious produce. Everything is farm fresh and local. I have never been to the farm but everything is delicious that comes in the CSA boxes. Tons of variety too, each week is different. Seasonal so everything is delicious. I get so excited when a CSA box is dropped off at my home. Wow let me tell you store bought flowers don't last but the bouquet of flowers I have gotten has been here for 3 weeks+ and it's still beautiful! And there was enough flowers to fit two vases. Obsessed with their CSA boxes.""]"

Thankfully Uber did refund the cost of the milk tea but I just want to post a review here to encourage the restaurant to do a better job.Edit: changed from 2 stars to 1 star After trying the meal I mentioned before (tonkatsu ramen), I realize that the food quality wasn't much better.The packaging was alright this time and they had plenty of ingredients for the price but the quality of the ingredients were really really bad.

I remember when facing east noodle bar opened, it had some mixed reviews so I never really had an urge to try it. Couple years later I went back to the reviews and based on the reviews, it looked like they improved.So I came here for lunch yesterday and I have to admit that a lot of their new items looked so good. Trying not to over order and overeat LOL I'd ordered really three appetizers so I can just try a variety of items.I ordered the grilled beef tongue with onions and I have to say it was good but I was hoping more of a char taste because it was supposedly grilled, but the sauces really took over the taste of the actual tongue. Second I ordered the spicy pork wonton and these were okay. It wasn't spicy at all and the chili oil sauce was very sweet which I did not anticipate. Lastly I ordered the duck bao and this was good but also overly sweet.Overall, this place was okay based on the items I ordered. The service is really good, our server was really nice and attentive. It was an overall good experience. It wasn't amazing as I would have hoped but that's okay. I would come back here to possibly try their entrees especially their rice bowls. Their rice bowls sound and look really good - so I'll be back!"", ""Pretty solid spot. I went here as a recommendation from a friend that lives in San Diego. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. I went as a party of 6 people so we were able to try a bunch of different things. We got the soup dumplings, shu mai, har gaw, wontons in chili oil, mapo tofu, spicy garlic wings, takoyaki, and filet mignon noodles. I liked that everything comes out as soon as it's ready. It helps with not overcrowding our table with everything we ordered. I really liked their soup dumplings and shu mai. Great flavors and comes to you right from the steamer. I liked the har gaw too but I think it spent a little too long in the steamer so it didn't stay together as well. The wontons in chili oil were good. The wontons were a little small but I really liked the flavors from the chili oil. The mapo tofu was okay. It was missing this signature szechuan sauce that add some heat and tanginess to the dish. The wings were solid. I wish they were more meaty wings but they had a nice crunchiness to them without drying out the meat on the inside. The takoyaki was as expected. It could have used a little more the unagi sauce and the white sauce but still very good. Lastly, the noodles were surprisingly good. I didn't know what to expect. I hadn't had anything like it. The was a generous amount of meat which I liked. The noodles were cooked well. There was a lot of good flavors in the dish. I was just surprised to find fries in the noodle dish as well. Overall, a good experience."", 'I give this place 3.5 stars. Some dishes we ordered were better than others. I liked the braised pork rice and the Xiao Long Bao the best. They have a large menu so I wished we had a larger party so that we could try other items. Maybe next time!', 'The food here was okay. It was nice to see such a wide selection of Asian dishes from Korean to Japanese. I tried the filet mignon fried noodle. XLB pork dumplings and the XLB colored dumplings which are all uniquely different. The fried noodle was so so. Nothing really stood out. The XLB dumplings were decent but really lacked that Shanghai soup flavor and authenticity. Skip the colored dumplings. The green spinach ""vegan"" dumpling has no place on the menu...gross and no soup inside. \xa0In the end, I left feeling full but not completely satisfied.', ""When we were seated there was a QR code for menus and you can order directly from your phone and the food will come to your table. There's also a call button if you needed the waiters attention. Service was great and our food came out quickly! The few dishes that we enjoyed were the bok choy, garlic soy edamame, and pork xiao long bao. Everything else was okay."", ""We came hungry after a massive hike at El Capitan. We needed food and arrived when they first opened for the day and it wasn't packed. It was the first week indoor dining could resume, so we sat inside. Decor was very unique and eccentric. Due to Covid, you scan the barcode and order on their site, and pay each time. This was good as we were able to order our own thing and not have to split bills or anything. Menu looked like a huge selection of mostly Asian dishes. We ordered a variety of things, the Xiao Long Bao, karaage chicken, popcorn chicken, spicy pork dumpling, braised beef noodle soup, filet mignon fried noodle and garlic beef fried rice. The XLBs were okay, some fell apart when you took it off the steamer, it stuck to the paper, a little thick for the dumpling. The popcorn chicken was horrible, no flavors at all. They put the spicy powder but still no flavor, karaage had a little more flavor and would prefer that over the popcorn chicken. Definitely not Taiwanese chicken if you're looking for that. Spicy pork dumplings were pretty good. The braised noodle soup was good but didn't feel like a traditional one. Our favorite dish was the garlic beef fried rice. It was good but they did need like a bibimbap sauce on it. Overall, the food wasn't amazing but wasn't bad. Worth trying but not worth the price tag in my opinion. Glad I was able to at least cross it off my list.""]"

Tried the shio ramen and the spicy ramen (spice level: extra hot). I could've gone up on the spice level on the spicy ramen, I didn't find the extra hot too spicy. I added butter and to the spicy ramen and it balanced out the spices. Extra green onions come shredded and there's a lot, I'll ask for them on the side next time. Flavor wise- no complaints. Broth was delicious, noodles cooked perfectly. Loved both the Negi Pon and Nagoya chicken. Large pieces, juicy, and flavorful! Not like the little over-breaded karage and other places.Cool decor, clean restroom, and great service!Parking in the complex depends on what time you go."", ""LOVED IT!!! Honestly one of the best ramen I've had in San Diego and I've tried a lot! I had the negi miso ramen with an extra egg. The quantities are really generous and the customer service is really knowledgeable.See you again soon!"", 'Hands down one of my favorite ramen spots in SD. I HIGHLY recommend getting their karaage! Juicy fried chicken! Everything in the ramen was spectacular. Seasoned soft boiled egg - so you have that yummy jammy egg yolk texture \xa0and the portion is great. Fills me up!! I know lines can get long so make sure to add yourself on the Yelp waitlist to help offset the long waiting times :)', ""We went to this place for today's Lunch. Shio Ramen was really good! It was tasty soup even No GMO. I went to with my friend this time, but want to bring my kids next time because soup taste really healthy. I thought parking could be hard, but it was not difficult to find spot in front of parking lots. If you wait 5 mins, you can find it. It is easier on night time. Usually, Ultra Ramen in different location are always full and have to wait to seat, but this location doesn't need to wait so far. \xa0I can recommend for family. Of course couples,too."", 'Came here on a weekday, shortly after opening. There were several other customers, but otherwise no wait and plenty of open seats. Customer service was great. Friendly and attentive staff. The ramen- hmmmm while the broth had a lovely flavor, it wasn\'t as rich, creamy, and savory as i know it to be from the other menya location. It would have been perfect if i requested ""less salt"". Still, the noodles were made right and the soft boiled egg with the still runny yolk and tons of flavor was spot on. In contrast, we ordered their fried chicken in sweet soy and this ended up a bit too salty. Maybe ask for the sauce on the side or stick with the original? Generous size pieces, lots of meat, crispy coating. I love menya, so im gunna have to come back again soon!', ""Yes, a second location! We needed it as the Clairemont Mesa place is always so crowded and you gotta be quick to beat the long line. And it's all just as good. We conveniently used the online queue and it was perfect coming from a hike. We got a nice table next to the window. Seating was still social distanced. The decor was cool and refreshing. I loved the stunning orchid on the table next to us and the deco skateboards on the wall. We started with the chicken wings first. Yummy just like the other shop. And we all got different kinds of ramen. It was all super delish. Can't beat that slurpy broth! And those noodles. Thanks Son, for thinking of this place for Mother's Day!"", ""I came here while in SD. Not sure if they're still doing the promotions, but they had really great prices and discounts on ramen and beer. The beer I got was super delicious and refreshing. I ordered the miso ramen, at level 2. The waitress totally lied, cuz that was the spiciest ramen I've ever eaten. But flavor wise, the ramen was solid: not the best I've ever had, but not the worst. However, my favorite thing there was the chicken. We got two different kinds, and they were both so flavorful and juicy. Definitely would come back just for the chicken. The service was also very good. The server made good recommendations for alcohol and ramen, and came often to refill our water and check in on us. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone in SD craving ramen or fried chicken. Just be warned that the spice levels here are something else."", ""*3.5 stars*I've been to the Clairemont Mesa as well as the Mira Mesa locations and have always loved their delicious Ramen. I decided to come check out the Hillcrest location for their Grand Opening, as well as take part in the specials they had going on. Super nice interior, about the same size/occupancy limit as the other two locations. You can't see the chefs making the food here though! Same ordering system - you have a photo menu to reference to, and you mark down your order on a paper slip.Miso Ramen ($12.95): I usually get Low Sodium because I enjoy drinking all of my broth, and this time I'm really glad I did - I tried my boyfriend's normal Miso broth and his was a LOT saltier than what I remembered, even for a normal bowl. I also always add on a Seasoned Egg ($1.00) because Menya always had tasty, perfectly soft-boiled eggs. However our Eggs this time were a bit more cooked through. My boyfriend also got a slab of Butter in his, even though he didn't order it, and was charged for the add-on. I also remember the Miso Ramen noodles to be thicker than the other Ramen options, but it seemed like we got thin noodles? Not sure if this was a chain-wide change, or if our orders were just off.Braised Cha Shu ($5.00): Only available to the first 4 customers at lunch and the first 4 customers at dinner, so be quick! We were able to get the last order luckily! This was very tender, but again, seemed much saltier than before.The other locations are a lot closer to me than this Hillcrest location, so I'll probably keep going to those. Not only for the distance, but also because I think this location needs to adjust a few things still."", 'Welcome to the neighborhood \xa0Menya Ultra! Hillcrest has several ramen options, but Menya tops the list of options. Similar to other Menya Ultras, this location was busy. You should add your name to the Yelp wait list before driving over. Our wait was close to 30 min on a Tuesday night. Dine in or take out only. I ordered the Shio Ajitama Ramen and fried chicken when I visited. The ramen was delicious. Egg was cooked just right. Ramen had a nice bite to it. Broth was rich and came out nice and hot. Fried chicken was nothing like the Convoy location. Either the oil was old or they overcooked the chicken, but our chicken came out dark brown almost burnt in color. They also do not serve lemon with their chicken here.Although the Convoy location is still better, for the fried chicken amd especially because Hillcrest location does not have Tonkatsu ramen, I still love the convenience of this new Hillcrest location.']"

You either gotta shell out $20 per dish or get stuck with subpar quality. My favorite used to be Tahini but they've gone downhill, now its Zgara! Cheap, big portions, tasty food.Highly recommend the pork souvlaki sandwich and gyro sandwich. We also ordered side of fries which is big. They don't skimp out here and everything is fresh. My only feedback is super random...but you don't usually notice this at restaurants til you across places that don't do this. When using the restroom, the trash can is not right next to the door. It would be nice if this was the case since most often, people wash their hands and dry it using paper towel. Then they don't want to touch the door handle so they use towel to open door and then quickly throw it in trash can.

We always get the house-made pork gyro platter and hummus with pita. My little one is obsessed with their feta cheese spread that is served with the platters. The portions are so generous that it's plenty of food for our family of 3 to share. The zgara salad is pretty tasty, albeit a little heavy handed with the capers. They seem to get a steady stream of business during the weekends but are never too busy. The food comes out quickly, but you can just tell they really put care into what they are serving. They have a couple of tables inside and a few small tables outside. Go check out this family-run business that's turning out the best gyro in town!"", ""Amazing wraps! Many kebab places use premade meat and just reheat it and you can taste the difference. They make theirs from scratch daily and you can clearly taste the difference! I tried their gyro (pork) and kofte (beef+lamb), both were super tender and moist and very flavorful. The seasoning was perfect as some places over season and make it a tad salty and overpowering the natural flavor of the proteins. Not this place! The wrap /pita bread used was very fluffy and super tasty! If you are hungry, one wrap is probably not enough, I could eat two easily!It seemed empty but once you go inside, you will see they have a ton of phone/online orders as they are constantly making food and packing stuff! So there is definitely a high turnover!Definitely my new fav place for wraps! It's little remotely located but it's worth the drive! I might end up getting their plate next time instead as the portion is larger."", 'The pork gyros are amazing! \xa0The pita is soft and fresh, and the tender, flavorful pork is piled high! \xa0Very generous portions, and the $9.99 lunch specials come with a drink and fries. \xa0Great value and very satisfying!', ""I watch the pork gyro cooking on a spit.\xa0 The owner slices off some for my sandwich.\xa0 Pita bread has a fresh flavor enhanced by juicy tomatoes\xa0and crisp lettuce.\xa0 The pork is what makes this one of my favorite sandwiches.\xa0 Tender and juicy I was amazed by the delicious flavors.I was very impressed\xa0by how nice the owner was.\xa0 He was working on my order and at the same time helped me take some great photos.\xa0 Bring cash if you want to avoid the 50 cent credit card fee.I had my first taste of Greek food when Daphne's opened.\xa0 My last few visits\xa0I\xa0wasn't\xa0that impressed\xa0by Daphne's.\xa0 Zgara Greek Grill dishes were fresh and bursting with flavor.2nd visit I tried the pork gyro plate.\xa0 You get everything you get with the pork gyro sandwich plus a side.\xa0 I chose french fries which were crispy and had a nice potato flavor, \xa0The plate is great for when you are very hungry.\xa0 The pork, pita bread, and veggies tasted just like my previous visit.3rd visit I tried the soulaki pork plate.\xa0 Soulaki\xa0pork was tender juicy\xa0and had\xa0delicious flavor.\xa0 Rice was soft and moist with that distinctive flavor of Greek rice.4th visit I tried the\xa0kofte plate.\xa0 Mix of beef and lamb had texture like hamburger while the flavor was rich and delicious.Cool neighborhood.\xa0 A few blocks away there was a Toys R Us.\xa0 When I was a kid I got to visit to pick out a present for either my birthday or Xmas.\xa0 Later I would find stuff for my kid.

Because it is that good!I love the regular pork gyros (good for me because I don't eat beef, which is in most gyros) and all. But I just tried the chicken gyros sandwich and it was AMAZING! Beautifully seasoned chunks of real chicken off the skewer (not just shavings off the giant block). Yum. Yum. YUM. I don't know if a gyro sandwich is life changing, but their chicken gyro takes me back to the kebab shops of Europe and cranks it up to 11."", ""This used to be a Little Caesars Pizza outpost on Morena Blvd for the longest time. ZGARA Greek Grill did some interior remodeling and then opened about a month ago. There were about a half dozen spaces located in front of the row of commercial suites. Not all of the businesses are operating right now so the parking situation was pretty easy.Sandwiches, platters, and salads made up the bulk of the menu offerings. Instead of going for a gyro with the meat fresh off the spit, I elected to try a Kofte platter which was two rolls of seasoned ground beef and lamb. The dish was accompanied with rice, tzatziki, feta cheese spread, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and grilled pita bread.For $15.75, the amount of food was decent. I didn't find the quality of the meats in the rolls to be different than any other Mediterranean style eatery. What I probably should have done was follow the trend and ordered a sandwich to taste for myself how authentic their style of pork gyro really was compared to other Greek places in town.""]"

So... the much lauded grilled octopus salad tasted weird and it's because it tasted like it had butter all over it and it didn't have a grill taste.

Should only be olive oil. \xa0 But the arugula and white bean salad with it was really good. \xa0The local grilled fish sandwich selection was poor. \xa0Only 4 choices and swordfish was the only one that looked good. \xa0And shrimp from Patagonia is not local.The bread was tasty, but the swordfish was way over cooked and dry and the portion was only about half the size of the bun. \xa0The coleslaw was awful.. it was just grated cabbage with lemon juice on it. \xa0No nothing. \xa0 Not even salt. \xa0For real?!? \xa0The fries were over cooked and over salted but stood out after what we just had. \xa0Even the iced tea was mediocre and weak. Have to say the bussers were all over it and props to them, for making the place turn over and being cheerful. This place has a rep that honestly is not merited.

She really likes this place and said the bread was great!It was very good I ordered a half grilled cheese gorgonzola, Brie on basil Rosemary bread.My friend ordered a roast beef sandwich and said it was very good.They have a nice patio and it was very busy at 12. We did find a nice place to sit in the Sun.I bought a loaf of Walnut cranberry raisin bread and they will slice it there for you.My friend ordered a cinnamon bun which we both agreed was so so LOL.Next time I think I'll just go in there and get dessert and a good cup of coffee.Nice and area inside, friendly cashiers really good lighting and lots of social distancing.. except when I was taking photos. I'm bad.If you like baked goods this place is for you. Definitely going back."", 'I love hazelnut so I had to try the Chocolate HazelnutTwist. I also love powdered sugar so no doubt this would be a hit for me. The Almost Grilled Cheese small was actually too much for me to eat in one sitting. The fresh-baked rosemary and olive oil bread was perfectly paired with sharp gorgonzola and triple cream brie. It warmed up nicely in my air fryer. I gave it one less star because they messed up my order again. This time I knew to check it and there was a PB&J and the sandwich I ordered was missing. They were going to let me keep it and make the sandwich I ordered \xa0but someone in my running group had my sandwich and I had hers and we were okay swapping. Last time they left out a loaf and I had to come back. Both times they were very willing to make it right. I would recommend you check your order before leaving, I do come back often as their breads are so fresh and good', ""We love con pane but after today's visit I can't be certain I will be back. S#!T show and a half doesn't cover the poorly planned and horrible chaos that we encountered today. I stood there for over an hour with others who were just as furious with the hectic environment to get sandwiches. Don't mind the kids who were aching for food. DO NOT EVER ORDER VIA ONLINE. holy cows. It tells you you will have to wait 50 min. Round that up to over an hour. It's faster to come and stand in line and place your order. They had no system to organize the online orders. Basically they satiated the angriest person first and slowly it was just everyone who was angry. And forget social distancing... The quality of the sandwiches have dropped significantly. They slather on the gruyere cheese so much that it becomes an unpleasant balance in the sandwich. I don't know what takes them so long because the haphazard, slapped together sandwich could hardly take a minute to put together. It was a pathetic presentation of food from what I recall it being (i.e. before the Cohen group took over) (funny thing to see a CBP Officer getting lunch today too and seeing him get free treats for the inconvenience of waiting). \xa0You could tell they just started throwing ingredients together just to get the orders completed. The worst was the petite lady who wears way too much eyeshadow for her age. Think mimi from the Drew Carey Show. She started to assist putting together my order after I've expressed my growing concerns of having stood there watching patrons come in and out for the past hour. She addressed the order half way then decided to just walk away not giving two fcks and go to lunch laughing. Legit just disappeared.... My mouth was hanging open with the experience.Horrible management of the situation. Sandwiches that have dropped in quality. Truly disappointed and don't know if I would recommend or return. Bummed because we used to live this spot so much."", ""I am so glad they are back open. I've missed their cinnamon roll!Went within an hour of them opening and there wasn't a line. As soon as I finished there was a line out the door! You can order online and pick up at a separate counter now.Tried:Roast beef sandwich on sourdough - goodTurkey Cobb on artisan wheat - the crust was incredibly hard. I would get this without the crust next time or with a different type of bread. Ask for the bread to be toasted!Cinnamon roll - ask for it warmed up! So good and amazingly gooey, heaven.Butterscotch latte - good, but recommend iced as the flavor pulls through more. A little milkier than I remember, the flavor wasn't as strong.Also tried their gruyere and chive bread. SO good; only available a few days each week."", 'There have been too many sad stories of local businesses closing this year. I\'m so happy to get to write this review of a business reopening.To be fair, I have a lot of favorite local bakeries, but Con Pane was definitely one of them in the ""before times."" When then had to close down in January I was really bummed. When word came out over the summer than the Cohn Restaurant Group had bought them I was... dubious. I haven\'t been a big fan of any of the Cohn restaurants. I was thrilled that Con Pane would be coming back, but worried about what would change.I realize it\'s still early days, but I\'m happy to report that Con Pane under Cohn is as delicious as ever! They still have all of their old menu items (or at least the ones I remember), and the bread is still delicious. They also seem to have added some new items, like the Christmas stollen, which is everything your grocery store stollen is not.On the COVID management side of things, they\'ve been overwhelmed with demand (we\'re all happy they\'re back - three cheers!) and aren\'t offering online ordering for holidays. Usually though you can order in advance on their website and pick up in store. For now you can place your order inside, then wait outside on the patio until they bring it out to you. They\'re very popular, so even if you\'re only getting loaves, be prepared to hang for a bit. Believe me, the bread is worth the wait.In a year of so much grief, this business coming back is definitely something to celebrate.']"

Wait times are not worth your time.', ""My family and I were vacationing in La Jolla. We were looking for a brunch place that had options other than breakfast (given it was 10am at the time) and kid friendly! Yelp recommended this place! We saw that Yelp also had a waitlist for this joint, which stated the wait was 45min to an hour. This did not stop us. We ended up site seeing a little while we waited. We checked in 15 minutes prior to the wait time. Approximately 30 minutes after, we were sat, which was still within the seating time on the waitlist. We got outdoor seating, which was perfect weather for it! My 6 yr old ordered the kid's French toast and my 4 year old ordered the kid's cheese quesadilla w/fruit. They both enjoyed their meals so much, they ate it all and bragged how much they loved it! My husband ordered the tuna melt and I had the salmon pasta. My husband said the tuna melt was the best tuna sandwich he ever had! He hardly ever finishes his food, but he ate all of it, including the seasoned fries it comes with! It was that good! I cannot express the flavor of the salmon pasta! If you are a lemon flavor fanatic, you will love this! The flavor is tangy, garlicky, and the tomatoes in it give it a small sweet kick. The salmon was cooked to perfection and added a great flavor to the pasta! I would definitely order this again! I wish I had taken pictures for you all, but the food was sooooooo good, we ate it all immediately after receiving it! I would highly suggest giving this place a try! The wait can be long, but worth it! Just join the waitlist on Yelp! It helps tremendously! Please don't let the negative reviews make you bypass this joint!"", ""I'll start by saying that this place is adorable and the food is tasty, with very large portions. My no so great service experience: I arrived with a party of 2 on a Sunday at 8am. Most tables were full on the patio but also a few empty. We were kind of acknowledged by the host when he said, I'll be back. When he did return, he pointed to a booth across the patio and said take that one. We waited 10 minutes for someone to take our order and ordered coffee and food. 25 min later we asked someone where our waiter was and if we could get coffee (yes we timed it). Our food came out about 5 minutes later, no coffee. Disclaimer: maybe it was just me that had this experience? Everyone else had a friendly and prompt welcome, coffee within 2 minutes, and a server checking in often but not as a bother. I might go back if I'm in the area but would likely just try somewhere else."", 'We were looking for some brunch options in La Jolla and came across this place on Yelp with stellar reviews. Thankfully you can join the waitlist through Yelp which is highly recommended! We joined the waitlist before driving to the spot, between driving and finding street parking (~40min) we were just in time when our name got called. The place was very busy but the staff was very patient and fast. They have a beautiful patio and some indoor dining as well. We were seated outdoors. We got Avocado Smash, \xa0Eggs La Jolla and Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. The lemon ricotta pancakes were the star, I wish I had gotten more than a single pancake. Definitely recommend this for brunch, make sure to join waitlist in advance.', ""Had a great brunch here :) loved the waitlist option on Yelp instead of having to stand in line for an hour! They didn't rush us which we loved. Go for the pancakes or stuffed French toast!"", ""Busy busy busy! Come early or be ready to wait for brunch. We were so lucky we were able to get seated fairly quickly. I ordered the Mexican mocha: more mocha than anything, although there was a shot of espresso. Not too sweet but I wish it tasted either more of the mocha or the cinnamon taste. I recently ate at the Black Bird Cafe in Long Beach and ordered the same and it was delicious so maybe I was expecting the same? Stuffed French toast: oh OKAAAY guys. You can order a half order (comes with 2) or a full (I think 4). Thick bricks of brioche folded around strawberries and mascarpone, with bursts of orange zests throughout. With fresh fruit and warm syrup all over, you can't go wrong with a sweet breakfast dish.Mexicali Benedict: I love soyrizo and it was on top of corn cakes (think of sweet corn tamale cakes) covered with a creamy hollandaise sauce and poached eggs. The sweet corn cakes balanced the savory soyrizo well. Add in runny saucy eggs...and u got a winner.The hubs ordered the Eggs La Jolla Benedict. I don't think he was impressed, however, compared the the flavors of the other dishes. Dropping a star due to cleanliness. Fruit flies covered the canvas painting and wall our booth was against and many fruit flies were buzzing around our table. Crumbs and food from earlier patrons were in the booth and utensils were on the floor underneath our table."", ""Even (during COVID times) with sitting outside on my first time here, I was still able to appreciate this cute little restaurant. \xa0Vegetarian review of brunch:There was the ability to get on the waitlist, so the line wasn't an issue. \xa0Parking wasn't too bad on a Saturday morning either, but then again, I don't know what it looks like on a regular day. \xa0Cinnamon swirl pancakes: delicious. \xa0The buttermilk pancakes were great, and with the toppings of cinnamon and and the frosting, the whole combination worked perfectly. \xa0Soy chorizo hash: this was also good with the hash in these small tortilla cups. \xa0Lots of flavors that all work well together.Service was great, very attentive. \xa0Definitely worth visiting."", 'We went here for brunch on Monday and the place was packed! We were shocked at how busy it was for a weekday, but were still able to get in within a few minutes. They have a ton of outdoor seating options. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We started with the fresh squeezed juice - orange and tangerine and they were both so clearly fresh and delicious. They were also a good glass size, so often I feel like I get ripped off with juice at restaurants. We then both ordered the Morning Glory Sandwich and it was so, so, good. Yum! There was a perfect blend of flavors, my only slight complaint was that there were a few too many onions (but those are so easily removed). I would definitely return to this place I was ever in the area again!', ""I've come here for two years in a row! I came last year before the pandemic ended and it was amazing. I couldn't forget those lemon ricotta pancakes! I always recommend them cause they taste soooo good! Make sure that you get on that waitlist right on time. They are always booked and you could wait at least two hours for a seat. We had to time getting on the waitlist with the time that we were going to get there."", 'Service and food was outstanding. Indoor and outdoor seating and dog friendly. Casual but prompt and friendly servers.

Massive yikes man.You can even again see in the picture on your OWN SITE that I linked up above that there are no red onions in it, when they are clearly visible in other pizzas, meaning you had yellow onions in the original.YES I\'m giving you a one star review because of both your attitude on the phone of seeming completely nonchalant about things as well as offering a 20% discount for someone who never wants to shop at your place again, and your counter review here just seals it.I own a business myself, and if I EVER committed a mistake like this, here\'s everything I\'d do;#1 refund the customer in full, no questions asked#2 send them out the correct pizza they ordered, immediately, for free#3 change the website while I was on the phone with them#4 check when the website was last updated, and then check all orders in that time-frame that got the wrong pizza, call them up and offer refunds tooTHAT is how you operate a business, and THAT is how you care about your customers.And yes, I ate some of the pizza. I didn\'t enjoy the taste much because I hate red onions and cilantro, but if I\'m not going to get the $16 I paid for this pizza refunded, you better be sure I\'m not going to let it go to waste, because I needed to eat something to keep me going; I don\'t have the luxury of going to get something else to eat while I\'m running a business all day long.This has been really enlightening though just how little you care about your business\'s reputation or presentation to the public. Any decent businessman would have done those steps above to begin with, but man, imagine making a reply when you KNOW you\'re in the wrong and STILL not offering a refund and actually attacking the customer you literally gave the wrong pizza to.That\'s just depressing.--------------------*** ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW ***I got a BBQ chicken pizza here, and the website CLEARLY says it has black olives and garlic and regular onions.It arrives at my place with none of those, and now it has cilantro and red onions, both of which I hate.I call up to report the error, and I kid you not, the employee or manager or who knows what on the other end ACTUALLY TELLS ME that the PIZZA IS AS INTENDED.He says they updated the menu a while back and that they just didn\'t change it on THEIR OWN WEBSITE. This is an actual scam, literally.They didn\'t even seem really remorseful, just saying they\'d change the menu at some point, that they were ""sorry"" and that they\'d offer me 20% off if I called them directly next time.Why on earth would I order from this place ever again if I can\'t trust the menu or what I\'m ordering?No talk of them refunding the pizza either. Will never ever order from this place again, and I highly suggest anyone who wants to order here, to call the place up and verify explicitly what their items have, because the website sure won\'t be accurate.$20+ wasted.', 'We decided to order take out pizza on a Thursday since we had busy work days and we were lazy to cook for the kiddos. My husband called and ordered an XL 18"" half combo and half meat lovers. The pizza would be ready within 20-25 mins. It just so happened that on Thursdays Jason\'s has a 20% off promotion - SCORE!!!When my husband got home, our pizza was still hot and fresh. I was impressed with the amount of toppings the pizza had and the toppings looked delicious. The size of each XL slice is comparable to a Costco slice of pizza. Super generous. With the first bite, the toppings were crunchy and the amount of toppings was just enough per each slice. My husband noted that there were no red pepper flakes or cheese toppings available to grab so I don\'t know if it\'s available if you ask. We had extra at home so \xa0 It wasn\'t an issue for us. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the pizza, its taste, and the amount we paid. We had plenty left over for another meal and it was still as delicious if you placed in the toaster oven. Next we want to try their sandwiches!', ""I've been trying out all of the pizza places in the area and tried out this spot. The actual cheese and sauce were decent, so if I had to get it again I'd only get plain. The cheese tasted sort of like Costco cheese pizza. The toppings tasted low quality - canned pineapple, low quality ham. The crust had no flavor. My husband and I actually got in a fight over the last cheese slices because neither of us wanted to eat the topping side. We ended up throwing out the rest because it was so unappealing."", ""After passing by Jason's many times, we finally decided to try this neighborhood pizza spot this week. We ordered a large half and half pizza and an order of cheesy breadsticks for pick up. Personally, I'm very picky when it comes to pizza and I'm not a big fan of red sauce. Jason's doesn't seem to offer a choice of sauces though and I found the sauce to be slightly sweet. I thought the pizza was just okay but my boyfriend, who isn't nearly as picky about pizza as me, liked it better. The breadsticks were tasty but I think I would have preferred the garlic bread. Too bad there isn't a bread option that combines garlic and cheese because that's the winning combo in my book!"", 'The pizza is delicious including their cheese bread.The chicken wings taste just like chicken adobo', 'It\'s been a while since I\'ve ordered out due to COVID-19. This is one to my first stops eating out, I am focused on ordering from small local businesses in need of support. I\'ve been wanting to come here for sometime now. They offer free delivery which is wonderful since many of us are social distancing. I called ahead to order a 12"" pizza and garlic bread for dinner. Time for pick up was 20-25 minutes. It was ready when I arrived at 25 minutes. Their sizes range from 12"" smallest to 28"" largest create your own options or choose from their specials. They also offer sides, pastas and sandwiches. I went with their combo 12"" $14 with a side order of garlic bread $2 for 4 large pieces. The combo pizza includes pepperoni, sausage, green belle peppers, mushrooms, black olives and red onions. It\'s a great size for 2 people, for 1 person you\'ll definitely have left overs. The garlic bread is quite generous as you\'ll see in the photos. The pizza was okay, the crust was a little overdone. But luckily I don\'t eat the crust anyways. The toppings were good. Flavor was okay, it wasn\'t dynamic. The garlic bread was very generous, wasn\'t a fan of the garlic spread they used. It had a slightly odd after taste to it. Overall the food was just okay, it doesn\'t rival other pizza shops. I will say thank you to the owners for staying open and offering free delivery. Staff wore masks and gloves. Tables in front of the cashier counter for safe social distancing. I appreciate that they adhered to compliance with safety precautions.', 'We ordered a medium meat lovers to go. It was good and ready when promised. It was better than national pizza chains.']"

When we arrived there was no wait which was awesome and they had both indoor and outdoor dining (I came before CA lifted the mask restrictions and social distancing).

The perfect amount of heat and I love things that are spicy. The broth was so freaking good I drank it all. 100% would order this again. My boyfriend and I also got the Ahi Poke Chips and this was a bummer. I did not enjoy it because compared to the ramen, it was lacking something. I don't know what it was but it just wasn't good. Definitely save your money and get something else. I think this dish would be 100% better if instead of tortilla chips they used fried wonton skins to pick up the ahi tuna. The tortilla chips just threw the entire dish off I felt. Not only that, but our ramen came out well before our appetizer came out which was weird. Overall though, despite us not really enjoying the Ahi Poke Chips, the ramen here got us shook. This place's ramen is one I'll definitely recommend to friends going to SD cause seriously, I don't enjoy ramen (I prefer pho) but this place's ramen was so damn good. I wish I lived in San Diego so I could eat this place again, I can't wait to come back!"", ""Outstanding food and service. This place is starting to become my go to for lunch. And it does not disappoint. The Ramen is super delicious and fresh. I've been getting the chicken koji ramen and it absolutely hits the spot. Also it seems to be relatively guilt free, because my stomach doesn't feel super bloated after slurping it up. It comes with thin wheat noodles and all the usual accouterments, including succulent pieces of chicken breast, seasoned half hard boiled egg, and spinach. Throw in some sriracha and chili oil and you have perfection. Service is phenomenally good. Very attentive, always refilling your drink. Will be back again regularly.""]"

So glad we stumbled upon this gem!The lady operating the register was very polite, kind, & sweet. The dining room is currently closed but she mentioned it will open beginning July 1st. We did take out and ordered chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, garlic cilantro naan, & chicken momos. Our order took about 20 mins to be ready, everything is cooked to order and piping hot. (Which I appreciate so much!) Moving on...The curries were SO tasty. Just packed with flavor. Mmm. I also appreciate the fact that their curry has a thick consistency, rather than runny. Definitely the best I've had. The garlic cilantro naan was amazing! Can't imagine how much better it would have been to eat it fresh. Since we had to drive back home, it sat in foil for about 10 mins and became a bit soft but still so so delicious! Now for the chicken momos- I've had many from various restaurants around the world and these are by far THEE BEST!!! I love the sauce they give us to dip it in. Prior to yesterday, my boyfriend never cared for chicken momos... but he was blown away by how delicious they were and kept eating them. This says a lot as he's never really excited over mediocre tasting foods! The food from here is far from mediocre! Needless to say, we definitely will be back! Go try this place out You will not regret it."", ""This place is our favorite Indian restaurant in San Diego! I'm a vegetarian and my boyfriend eats their chicken and lamb dishes, and the food has always been delicious when we've ordered off the menu. One time, my dad came to visit and we went to their buffet, and I don't know if it was an off day or what, but the food was not that great, so I don't recommend the buffet. I wish there were more locations so we didn't have to drive across town for it, but it's definitely worth it.They've had some issues with orders not being ready on time, but I feel like they're getting better at handling it. We order from a third party app, and before, the order wouldn't be ready until over an hour after we ordered it. Lately, they've been on top of it with alerting us that there's an X minute delay. It also doesn't hurt to just come after the ready time too since they pack the food so well, it's always piping hot after getting it home after a 20 minute drive."", ""I hate to do this. The food is actually very good. We stick to the basics - Chicken Tikka, Chicken Momo, Cheese Naan. We have tried a few other items, all good, but we like these popular dishes the best. In fact, we like the food so much we keep coming back but this will be the last time. Even if you order online one hour ahead of time, your food will not be ready and they will be confused when you try to pick up. This has happened more than once so I told myself to give them extra time and order early but it doesn't seem to help. \xa0 Evidently the 3rd party apps work better for them but if that's the case, why have an order function on the website??Again, this is not a one time occurrence. I dislike reviews that complain about service on one occasion. I'm sure if you order two hours in advance you will have a 50/50 chance of your order being ready and correct. Are you feeling lucky??"", 'One of the best Indian restaurants in San Diego. We ordered Chicken Sandekho, Chicken Niravana and Chicken Biryani. I would have prefered Chicken Sandekho to be a bit spicier but it was a very good appetizer to start with. Chicken Nirvana is a very rich gravy and goes very well with naans. Chicken Biryani here is not the authentic Indian style biryani but I would totally recommend it for someone who is willing to try something new.', ""Ordered lunch here - got the chicken biryani and vegetable samosas. The portion of rice for the biryani was like for 10 people - except there was very little chicken. Probably 2 pieces of meat cut up in the entire rice. The rice wasn't cooked all the way and didn't have the customary raisins and nuts in it. The samosas were very good."", ""This place have become a covid go to \xa0for me. \xa0Located in mira mesa right next to trader joes Himalayan grill serves a nice tasty indian meal. \xa0They do a nice job of preparing food that is not overly spicy (unless you request it). \xa0The problem with some places is that they just overwhelm you with spice so you can't enjoy the flavors. \xa0The Himalayan grill does a nice job of keeping the spice to a reasonable level.The Tikka masala is a nice rich flavorful sauce. \xa0I prefer the chicken or lamb version. \xa0I'm not sure if its just cause I get it take out but the sauce is a little greasy. \xa0The garlic naan is super garlic which is nice. \xa0Mango lassi is think and doesn't have that weird sour taste that some lassi get. \xa0Overall, a decent price for the quality you get. \xa0I would definitely recommend giving it a try."", ""Ordered the chicken tikka masala and chicken curry for pickup through grubhub. Order was ready for quick pickup when I got there! YummmmmI got 1 with rice and 1 with naan for my bf and I. We were glad we picked a diff carb because they gave so much rice (1 full container) and naan (4 small/medium pieces). Our fave was the chicken tikka masala, it was so flavorful and creamy. Chicken curry was not bad too! Slightly spicy but not sure if it's that way by default or because I requested medium spice online. It uses a tomato base so it's kinda nice to balance out the creamy chicken tikka masala.I'm very curious about the Butter Chicken!!"", 'One of our favorites for takeout! Our normal go to is chicken momo, garlic naan, butter chicken and chicken tikka masala. Tastes just as good the next day for leftovers. Consistently good!', ""Yum yum and yum! I have been wanting to try this but never saw it on the Zabihah app! Well, the location in Point Loma has halal meat.I would highly recommend this restaurant because it is so tasty and the food has great flavors. It tasted just like Indian food to me and all the food sounded Indian! The prices weren't too bad and I got a yummy chicken dumpling looking appetizer and it was good!Don't leave here without getting the garlic naan!!!"", 'I ordered the Sag Aloo which is spinach with chunky potatoes. The spinach was creamy, thick like gravy and spicy. The Veggie Korma was a coconut based curry with eggplants, bell peppers and peas. It was satisfying to eat and felt very comforting on a cold San Diego evening. The spices warmed me up and the flavOrs brighten my stomach. The basmati rice was aromatic, fluffy and honesty cooked perfectly since I am always picky about my rice.I highly recommend if you are looking for vegetarian options. And when ordering from Uber eats they package it very nicely and gives a big portion.']"

Due to quarantine being lifted, they were understaffed, but they were very friendly and apologetic about it. You can definitely tell they are trying their best. I started with a salmon rice ball and it was packed with salmon. They don't skimp at all! For dinner, the nabeyaki udon was delicious! I wish they served the tempura on the side, though, so they weren't as soggy. Their seaweed salad is one of the best I've ever had! I could have eaten an entire bowl of just that. But it did pair perfectly with the Kobe beef, which was cooked perfectly as well! Overall, coming back for sure! I can't wait to try their other menu items!"", 'Wa Dining OKAN is authentic Japanese food. Their hot pot rice bowls are good, but the mini skewers stole the show for me. The pork belly, scallops, beef, chicken skewers were all very good! I would eat those all day long. I had the fresh water eel hot bowl and my wife has the crab bowl. The eel bowl had strong flavors( umami, soy, sweet, salty). The crab bowl was subtle, but you can definitely taste the crab. I ate it with the skewer sauce ant it balance the flavors out for me.They have out door dining during Covid.', ""This is more of a 4.5-4.75 star rating than a pure 5 star, but this remains a hidden gem in San Diego. The things I believe they do best over all are udon and tempura. Their udon is delicious and perfectly cooked every time. Above all else their deluxe curry udon is filled to the brim with deliciousness and large enough to meet the biggest appetites. Combined with their fresh and perfectly cooked tempura (every time) and you're set for a perfect meal. The rest of the menu is a pretty big hodgepodge of food but alot of it is very tasty. I especially recommend their pork belly with egg, gobo salad, cucumbers, sashimi (not top sushi level but very tasty) and wings.If I had to say what I don't think they do well, there are two things. First, the standard Dashi for their udon isn't my favorite, but I don't think I'm a big dashi fan period. Second is the Yakitori; some of it is good, some is decent, but this isn't a place if you want top notch skewers of tasty meat.This is a great place for lunch or dinner and especially if you're looking for tempura and udon."", ""My first time at this location. It's definitely much smaller than the clairemont location and also they have outdoor seating at this one. My friend had the beef udon which he said was okay. I ordered the Kobe beef with ponzu and chopped tuna with green onion handroll. We also tried the mixed tempura. It was decent. Service was good and staff were very friendly! The parking lot can be alittle tough."", 'One of my favorite izakaya style spots in san diego. \xa0The rice bowl with mushroom and scallops is a must get here. \xa0I also really enjoy the udon, tempura and carpaccio. \xa0You really cant go wrong with anything here. \xa0Just come and enjoy the food and vibes.', ""We ended up this spot because the place we had originally at wanted to go to was closed. I had eaten at a couple of other places at this plaza, but never really took the time to walk around and see what else there was to offer.We decided on this place because the menu looked good and there were a decent number of people dining here. When you sit down they give you a specials menu that has a qr code for the full menu. They were out of a few things because it was the day after Memorial Day, but we're pretty easy so we ordered some other things. We ended up getting the grilled scallop skewers, the egg omelette, mentai udon, and kettle cooked eel rice with sweet soy. Let me tell you I am mad I did not try this place before!The scallops were perfectly cooked with a nice smokey flavor and little bit of crispiness from the grill. It was so good I inhaled it before even taking a picture of them. The eel rice comes out in the little kettle it was cooked in and they will serve it for you if you say yes when they ask. Say yes because they will prepare ans serve it theway it should be served. The rice was so flavorful and had a nice texture with the eel. The egg omelette soft and fluffy. The star for me was the mentai udon though. \xa0The flavor was so delicate yet complex at the same time. All the elements in the udon worked to give a balanced flavor and the springy yet chewy noodles were the perfect vehicles for the flavor. I can't believe this place is so close to where I live and yet I have missed out on eating here. It definitely reminds me of being back in Japan with the flavors, ambiance, and dishes. It is definitely a spot to check out if you love Japanese food or are trying to expand your horizons."", ""I've dined here a couple times in the past but came here today for the first time in a while. And boy was I really glad that I did! We tried the Pork Cheek and Sea Urchin/Scallop Carpaccio, which both were great. The pork cheek was very tasty and the carpaccio was just as delicious as I remembered from the first time I tried it. The Eel Rice Kettle was savory and reminded me of a nice home cooked dish. My favorite though was the Mentei Butter Udon. Super creamy and delicious. I would definitely recommend trying it!Staff was friendly, we (party of 2) got seated immediately at the bar when we got there - we came on a Sunday around 5:30pm. Overall a great experience and definitely will be coming here again."", 'Wow. Such a satisfying and delicious meal filled with so much Japanese comfort food. Our table of 2 was seated outside after waiting only 5 minutes. The servers were extremely busy but still remained attentive to our requests and served us quickly. We loved the Agedashi tofu and the seaweed salad. The vibes here are extremely chill and would definitely make me want to come back here to eat with family.', ""The food is always delicious here. I got the blue crab and mushroom bowl and it was good but it's definitely on lighter side compared to the braised pork belly one which is the one I usually get (it's delicious) the mackerel was delicious too but was disappointed that it was very small. My friend got the eel bowl and it's a burst of flavor. The chicken skewers were good too. The only issues I haves this time was that the service was really slow but I can see that they were probably understaffed. Also there was a HUGE cockroach \xa0but it was crawling around the outside seating area. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this place.""]"

I called for 2 sushi rolls on a Saturday afternoon at 4:36, and was told on the phone, ""it\'ll be 10-15min"" so I thought, ""well, they took a while last time, maybe I\'ll give them 20min...to be sure"".

While living in Hawaii one of my favorite meals to get was Chicken Katsu Curry. Unfortunately getting a round trip ticket to Hawaii just to get that meal didn't seem very ideal. For the past couple years coming back to California I have been on the search for a over all good chicken katsu curry. Upon coming here, all outside seating was available but no indoor seating. My boyfriend got the chicken teriyaki bowl, while I, of course, got the chicken katsu curry. I was absolutely thrilled with the prices $17 for everything from what I remember, or around that price.The chicken was cooked and breaded perfectly! No fatty annoying pieces. The sauce was savory and perfect, the rice soft and not overcooked it undercooked. My boyfriend said the chicken for his teriyaki bowl was excellent but that for him, there wasn't enough teriyaki sauce to cover the amount of rice that they served.It's been really hot lately but this area of San Diego has extremely nice weather and perfect for the outdoor seating. The parking lot is huge since it's located in a strip mall shared with other locations. Finally I do have the need to go to Hawaii just solely for chicken katsu anymore.""]"

Not great but not bad by any means. I've definitely had better and I think you could find a lot better in Pacific Beach. It's kind of a little hole in the wall spot but they did a good job with most of the decor. The place was decently clean including the restrooms but it could have been cleaned better. The prices were good for what you got. It wasn't overpriced and it wasn't super cheap. Overall this place was fine but probably not worth going back to."", ""The tuna tasted fishy, the fish tasted generally like low quality fish, and they charged me 50 cents (per wedge) for lemon wedges.

I picked up the food 15 minutes later per their instruction. I was gob smacked when they said the total was $55. I added my order up and it should of been $35. They said that was old pricing and they need to remove that from the web. They wouldn\'t honor their online pricing. My family and I were famished and I couldn\'t see wasting already prepared food. I was really bothered paying more than what was presented to me online still. Now the quality of our food was extremely disappointing. Second strike. If the food was even remotely good I wouldn\'t bother reviewing, but they sent seaweed and paste in a plastic container and wrote on the lid "" add hot water"". \xa0That was my SOUP! Assuming I had \xa0hot water to add which I didn\'t that\'s why I ordered take out. The avocado was brown and our vegetable tempura was flaccid. Our sushi rolls tasted fishy and like bleach.

Left \xa0me with the worst taste in my mouth!!!', 'The review is for dine-in. The food was average and it was quite a long wait (about 1 hour).

I have been a ""regular"" here since it opened and they have gone through so many versions of the bento box, I mean the actual box that the food is served in. They boxes keep getting smaller and now they are shallower too!The portion size is decreasing. I would rather pay more and not leave hungry. This applies to Niban the sister store in Clairemont-Mesa. Back to Ichiban... One lady at the register is very friendly, speaks and understands little English and moves in slow motion. I am not kidding, she moves as if in slow motion. I love to watch new customers observe her. I hope I am not making fun of someone with a medical condition. This place used to have lines out the door, now it\'s nothing special. Too bad. Used to be a great deal.', ""One of fav sushi spots in PB. \xa0Different from the others because you order when you walk in...then sit down. I have found the service to be WAY better ... less of a wait for a server to come to your table... and they clear off the empty plates really fast. \xa0The employees are all very nice and the food is really good. \xa0I am a sushi LOVER. \xa0Their nigiri is fresh I love the albacore and yellow tail. \xa0Really good sizes for the price. \xa0I love my Philadelphia roll and also the mango roll (I just found out I'm gluten intolerant so I have to stay away from crab mix and spicy tuna mix inside the rolls...and no special sauces). But. \xa0those 2 are defiantly gluten free! \xa0My friend swears by the teriyaki combo box and their egg rolls. \xa0I love their salad too. \xa0No parking lot but it's PB....It's street parking everywhere.

We are every single piece and the quality and quantity is amazing. They rice to sushi ratio is actually perfect, they actually give you a great portion when you get these combos! Parking is just a little tight but there is an option to park near k sandwiches and just walk to sushi diner.

The theme was reggae. Loved that. Ordered the crunch roll (a go to), shrimp lovers, Philadelphia crunch and the smile Jamaican. Nothing stood out and all kinda tasted the same.

Nothing could ever beat this quaint, hole-in-the-wall, Bob Marley themed spot :3This time, my sister and I ordered over the phone for pickup, since they aren't doing dine in yet. We ordered the dragon roll, crunch roll, baked salmon roll, and chicken teriyaki. The lady over the phone said it would be done in 25 minutes. She also said they're reopening dining in on June 15!The food was done in exactly that amount of time, and we were so excited to eat it when we got home. Everything was delicious! My favorite roll was probably the Crunch roll. It had imitation crab and shrimp tempura on the inside, and the combination of all the different textures with the sauce was unmatched! The baked salmon roll was also top tier, I like how it wasn't drenched in sauce like most places. It wasn't too heavy at all and was just perfect. The dragon roll was also super yummy but I'm not a fan of cream cheese, so I took it out. The chicken teriyaki came with salad, rice, and French fries and was also super bomb! It wasn't dry at all and so tasty, although I wish they gave a little more teriyaki sauce to put on the rice.

The place is a little small. \xa0Need to wait in line sometimes.', ""I've visited Sushi Diner in the past, and was immediately blown away by the theme and how really affordable everything on the menu was. I recall the rolls being really scrumptious but not amazing. The wait time was also kind of long. Fast forward to recently, I decided to give it another try and did a phone-in for pickup. I was out on hold for a while and told it would take 45-60 minutes for my order to be ready. The employee I spoke with was courteous. I think I arrived around the 40 min mark and everything was already done and sitting out, so I think they're good about giving you a buffer of time since there was quite the crowd waiting outside for to-go orders. Everyone seemed super industrious when I peaked in, so kudos to the staff for working so hard! I had the Damian Marley, the Rita Marley with salmon and the Seared salmon tataki roll (a little unsure about the last one). I honestly really enjoyed all of them! The rolls were better this time around than I recalled; quality of fish was good, portions were good, and flavor of each was cohesive. I especially enjoyed the Damian Marley because the tuna was so so good. The Cajun rub on the Rita also made the roll really special. I would definitely recommend all of them (and am craving them as I'm writing this delayed review). Truly, Sushi Diner deserves a 4.5 stars. I would definitely recommend checking it out (it's a little obscure so keep a keen eye out if you're driving to pick it up) and placing an order over the phone in advance."", 'One of my go-to places to buy sushi in San Diego is Sushi Diner 1.

This place has the most reasonable prices for sushi and taste of each roll/ fish is amazing. The only thing I wish they had more of is salmon rolls.

Would have given 4-5 stars if it wasn't due to the concern of the chef behind the counter wasn't wearing any protective gears while preparing food especially raw sushi / sashimi for customers. All other staff are wearing masks including another chef behind the counter. With the pandemic is spiking in town, to protect the safety of customers dinning and supporting the local restaurants, even the chef might have been fully vaccinated, should have the mask on while serving raw food.

We stopped by on our way from Mexico to Palm Springs and ordered two rolls, a couple of pieces of sushi, and several pieces of sashimi.

Not sure how much the total was but we got a bunch of rolls to try and they were all delicious! Great staff, nice ambience, but will have to come back to try real sushi from here. I feel like this review would be incomplete without one. There are a lot of sauces already on the rolls so you don't really need to ask for other ones, but I recommend eel sauce (a sweet viscous brown sauce) if you have a sweet tooth and want to make your rolls have that extra pop of sweetness. Spicy mayo is good if you need spice in your life, and the ponzu sauce adds a little sweetness and saltiness but don't drop your roll in.""]"

Both broths were good but udon tasted like what you can make from the store. The tonkotsu broth was yummy and creamy. The ramen was tasty and had texture and chewy. I would order the ramen again but the udon. The bento box was well worth the price. I wish the chicken had more teriyaki drizzle because it was a bit dry. Can't go wrong with tempura and they gave a huge container of sauce to dip. It was all veggie but the udon came with one shrimp tempura. I was also surprised that the lunch bento prince was offered on a weekend.Please don't forget to tip more since 19% discount was given."", ""Lovely little family restaurant with delicious Japanese food at extremely reasonable prices. This has become my local go-to for bentos, sushi, and udon. They have a great menu with lots of cooked and raw items, and when you order to-go they take extra care in packing things in a way that preserves the quality of the food. Even in the takeout boxes there is thought in presentation, and that gets major bonus points from me. We eat with our eyes before our mouths! So far we've gotten sushi rolls, appetizers, bento boxes, and udon. Every item has been super tasty and prepared perfectly. The rice is deliciously sticky and chewy, the teriyaki is grilled well, and the sushi is fresh. Like I mentioned above, it's all priced well too! My hubby and I got a very satisfying dinner for $20 total. I will continue to eat my way through their menu any chance I'm craving Japanese food!"", ""I'm sorry to say We did not have a good experience. The noodles looked like angel hair pasta in our yakisoba, an entire person's order was missing, one of our orders looks like half had been taken out, and the gyoza looked like something from a frozen package. We were really disappointed due To hearing good things about this place. Perhaps it was an off night but overall we were disappointed across-the-board - especially for the price!"", ""Even during the pandemic, the food is still awesomesauce at this mom and pop Japanese restaurant tucked away in Poway.We arrived for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Take out and very limited outdoor dining are the only options available as of my visit.Dine-in service is limited to three outdoor tables that are properly spaced apart under tarps set up in the parking lot right in front of the restaurant. Despite the limited dining space, it is actually a nice outdoor set up so as long as SoCal is not having a heatwave.Customers can still enter the shop to place and pickup take out orders.Customers who elect to dine-in must also place their order inside and pay for it before stepping back outside to sit down at any available table.I should note that the restaurant is offering a 19% discount off their standard menu prices! I was shocked how small my total order came out to be (which I essentially gave right back as a tip).Here's what I ordered:- Sukiyaki Beef Bento- Chicken Katsu Bento- Takoyaki (4)- Shrimp Tempura- Caterpillar Rollthe nice lady who took your order rushes out with the same cart they used to use inside the restaurant to serve food. Everything is packaged as if it is for take out and handed to you on a tray.I'm not even going to review the food because all of it was the same quality as usual--which is awesome! Sadly, the presentation is not ideal because everything is (carefully) packaged as if it is ready for take out, but all the usual quality is still there.After your party leaves, the nice lady who took your order rushes out to clear things off and disinfects the table for the next group.Keep in mind this restaurant is not a chain. This is a real mom and pop joint still serving good eats.Come on out if you're in the area and want some good Japanese served up with a 19% discount! The food here always reminds me of my time in Japan...that's how legit I think it is."", 'This place has a really large menu. You can can yakisoba (fried thick noodles), udon (soup noodles), bento boxes, sushi, nigiri (larger piece of meat on top of packed rice). I would order sushi more as appetizer here and add other items. What did I order? Creamy spicy roll, spicy yellowtail, salmon and ahi tuna sushi. All were delicious. I will come back and try more items, I have a feeling I will be bumping up the score to 5 stars if I try things other than the sushi.Quality - goodSize - sushi is really small compared to other places, so order moreSpeed - pretty fast 10 min wait for take out near closing timePrice - excellent, around $30 for two as a snack', 'Price was very reasonable and the salmon & chicken teriyaki bento box was very tasty.The owner was offering the discount since we all having a hard times due to Covid 19.Appreciate it.

Super nice people, excellent service, tasty food (monkey balls - yum!), reasonable prices and very clean. You can tell they care about their business and their customers and want to deliver quality on everything. Five stars for all these reasons.Long story: \xa0We're not usually in favor of dining out on Valentine's Day, but hubby and I had a craving for sushi Sunday night and ventured out for dinner at around 7:30pm - not unreasonably late for dinner normally, but in California COVID world, I guess it was too much to ask. Ai Sushi wasn't originally on our radar because we have a couple of other places closer to our house, but their hours and/or customer service were seriously lacking. (I won't name the offenders, but Carmel Mountain Ranch and RB were not up to par.) Who closes at 8pm on Valentine's night? Well, it's their loss because we had the best dinner at Ai Sushi!I'm so happy we discovered them in our Yelp search although I must warn, they still seem to be having some phone issues, so we almost didn't make it there, but don't give up! Website said they were open until 9:30, so to avoid more disappointment, we wanted to verify and called the Chevron station across the parking lot to ask if he would be so kind to tell us if the restaurant was open. (Five star review coming for them next.) The answer was yes!Arrived at around 8:30 and were seated right away underneath a nice outdoor heater. We were promptly given menus and were asked about drinks. After ordering, another server came out to ask us about drinks. Always nice to get extra service and I thought the self-serve water was a nice touch. Hubby's pet peeve is to have to wait for a water refill which sometimes never comes, plus they were super busy so this was perfect.Although it didn't seem like a long wait, they were very apologetic that they were having a hard time keeping up with orders and delivery so they brought us a seaweed salad on the house. The rest of our meal came shortly thereafter and we enjoyed everything. Monkey balls - amazing! Philadelphia roll - very good, but same as anywhere else. Jessica Alba - good and spicy, but a little too heavy on the onions. Pokie roll - fresh and delicious, this one was our favorite! We will be back soon to try more!"", ""I had to wait on my review until I've tried this place multiple times, and I'm here to say it's worthy!! Fresh sushi with fast service."", ""Love this place!

Because of Covid, I he seating inside is limited, but they do take out and we saw a lot of ppl come to pickup orders. Bf got the hamachi kama. It was a nice crispy, not over cooked crispy. It was so good. We ordered the crunchy roll, Jessica Alba roll and the albacore special roll. My favorite was the albacore special roll. Will definitely be back.', ""This has been my go to sushi spot recently. They have a buy two get one free roll promo going on everyday so it makes it worth getting the three rolls. The amazing dragon is my favorite roll so far. I've tried most of the rolls and they all are pretty good. The service is pretty good. I just order ahead and pick up.

Was curious to try a new restaurant which had its grand opening during Covid19. Upon entering, we waited at the entrance at restaurant. They had a promotion of buy 2 rolls get 1 free.We were given hand sanitizer and then got our temperature checks. Then we were told to sit anywhere available. For areas that they tried to keep social distancing, they had a handmade sign that said ""Sorry no service."" Outside before entering, you have to enter with a mask or face covering.Rolls we ordered-Crunchy Spicy Tuna: my staple favorite.Volcano Roll: Mr. W\'s favorite. He likes the combination of the mixed sashimi, imitation crab with the salmon on the outside along with the sauce. Hercules Roll: We weren\'t too big a fan. It was wrapped in cucumber, and I think the cucumber overwhelmed everything else within.Sushi rice seemed like it was fresh out of the rice cooker. It didn\'t seem like the usual sushi rice, but still tasted good. Service was a bit slower as only one waitress. I think they just started dine in and they\'re a pretty new restaurant. Would come again.']"

Basically a whole fried chicken with sauce on the side, to maintain the crispy skin.The chicken was very crispy, but also very DRY especially the breast. This was probably due to the fact that it was reheated, more about that in the service section. There was nothing spicy about their chicken as well.The sides were cole slaw and pickled radish, both lightly dressed and crunchy. The sweet and spicy sauce was just a quite thick sweet syrup, again no heat detected; it reminded us of a chicken katsu dip rather than a sweet chili dip.Probably won\'t give them another try. For this price, we would rather go out of our way back to Bonchon. The chicken, service, and fixings are much much better in our experience.Service:We called in our order ahead of time, 5:30pm, to avoid having to wait for our food to cook. We set up a pick up time of 7:15pm, and was doubly confirmed by the gentleman on the phone. We get there at 7:10pm to pay and get the food, and the young man states, ""the food has been sitting here 10 minutes and is soggy, would you like us to reheat."" Why would it be ready that much ahead of time? I requested a fresh batch and willing to wait, but another man with colored hair denied doing so, stating that the food was only sitting for two minutes. Two minutes and yet he claims that it is soggy and needs reheating? So I accepted the reheating - bad idea as the chicken became dry!I took the food and left. Only to have to drive back because the sweet and spicy sauce was missing. I could have done without the sauce as it just tasted sweet. Lesson here is to check your order yourself, even after they check the bag in front of you. Silver lining is they offered more complementary sides lol.Atmosphere:The place was pretty packed with people enjoying family time and crunchy chicken. Hopefully they had a better experience with service than we did. They do offer daily and lunch specials.', ""We were in the area and found this place so decided to try it out.Honey Garlic (mild) - their mild is not spicy.

I enjoyed the spicy soy.Cajun fries - portion was good but the fries were a bit hard.Daikon was great but the coleslaw was the traditional ones you get at Korean fried chicken places, it was more similar to American coleslaw.Overall, not our favorite korean fried chicken spot but it's decent."", ""Super EXPENSIVE chicken. \xa0You can do better with Raising Cane's.It's Rice, and it's Chicken. \xa0Oh yeah, Rice Chicken."", ""Sounds like a place that serves rice with chicken but it's actually a fried chicken place that uses rice flour instead of wheat flour to fry their chicken. They do actually have a number of fried chicken options to choose from. Went with the honey garlic chicken and snow cheese chicken and they didn't disappoint. The honey garlic sauce tastes great as a side as well. The snow cheese powder on the other hand needs to be allowed to melt to really get its flavor. Recommend putting it in the microwave first.Rice chicken has definitely nailed the crispiness and spice level though, compared to boss bird kitchen - one of the other (wheat!) fried chicken places around."", ""Really good fried chicken - I wish I had discovered this place before now! When I originally heard about Rice Chicken and looked at their menu, I was worried that it was going to be too spicy, but that wasn't the case. With the mild breading and honey garlic sauce, it was just a tiny bit of spice and a lot of flavor. The boneless chicken was more like popcorn chicken than fried chicken, not greasy but not dry either. The sauce was good, but there was only just barely enough for the chicken.Wasn't a huge fan of the Cajun fries, but they weren't bad.

Some of the food items were DELICIOUS! Some of them, not so good. However, I was reading the descriptions of the food on UberEats and the descriptiveness of them was cute and funny. The owners really tried to describe it as much as they could and sometimes with a little bit of history. :) Made my day. A bit part of my impression was that this restaurant is a mom and pop restaurant. I have heard that no one thought it would survive the pandemic and it was heart warming to hear it survived. Quality of Food: XLB: GREAT! Doesn't taste like it was just defrosted from frozen ones. You can see through the skin to the meat and might be as good as DTF. Pig Ear/Pig Tripe: Not much flavor to it. Wonton in Chili Sauce: Bit too much oil but it still tasted flavorful with an abundance of meat. Pork buns: Again, lacked flavor, but it felt homemade and the chewiness of the buns were good tooShao Mai: SKIP! Not flavorful. Spicy tofu: DELICIOUS! Next to the XLB my favorite. Flavorful and the tofu slipped through your mouth so quickly. Green onion Pancake: NOPE! It was dry and not much flavor Price for food: Not bad. Not good for what I paid for. If I were to go back, I would only get certain items."", ""Don't know why I don't hear more about this place. It's hard to find a good dumpling spot in SD and this isn't far from where I live apparently. Definitely one of the better xiao long bao options you're going to get here in this city. While their prices aren't super cheap for the amount of food you're getting, it certainly beats the cost of going to DTF. My partner and I we're able to get a reasonably filling meal for about $20 a person.While the XLB here are quite good, my favorites do far are the wontons in chili oil and the shumai. Very fresh, tender and flavorful.The people who work here are very nice too. I'll be going back."", ""Only take out due to covid. My daughters really wanted dumplings and this was the closest to our hotel.I thought the food was at a really fair price and everyone enjoyed their food. I wasn't too thrilled about the chow mein, I thought it was a little too bland and needed more cabbage. The noodles were a little too soggy for my taste, however, everyone else thought it was fine."", ""Okay my experience with Chinese food in Mira Mesa hasn't been great After finding this little hole in the wall I had my hopes up,,, after all the overall reviews have been 4 star Yelp review so I was eager to try it outI ordered xiao long bao ,,, spicy wonton ,,, two orders of shui mai ,, and green onion pancake ,,, yes lots food for one person ,,, Xiao long bao --- no flavor Spicy wonton -- no flavor ,,, dipped in oil but spicy sauce Shui Mai -- zero flavor ,,, I really wanted to like the food but zero flavor Green onion pancake -- don't bother with it ,,, one bite and I immediately regret getting this So food quality I would give one star Customer service three star (with all the food I ordered they gave me ONE napkin ,,, no soy sauce ,,, in fact the female owner took away the soy sauce her husband packaged for me lol)"", ""Stopped by this place on the way back home and ordered some takeout. We got the xiao long bao, spicy wontons, spicy tofu, and boiled dumplings which came out to about $37. We wanted to try the pan fried baos but they were out. The xiao long baos were 3/5; a decent amount of soup w/good filling but the skin was soggy. The spicy wontons were probably the best thing we got as the chili oil was pipin hot and the wontons were extremely juicy. The spicy tofu and boiled dumplings were kind of a let down as they weren't very flavorful. Overall, I would say it was a 3.5 stars and if you do come here get the spicy wontons and pan fried baos."", ""Came by for a quick lunch, this is definitely a take out spot but there are about 4-5 small tables inside if you want to dine in.We ordered the:-dumpling in chili oil: it was ok-xiao mai: a bit too soggy, did not have a very prominent taste -shrimp chow mein: way too salty-orange chicken: came with a side of rice. \xa0This was definitely our favorite. \xa0Not too oily, crispy, and chicken was not over coated.It did it's job for a quick lunch if you're in the mood for dumplings, but would not recommend going out of your way."", 'Really delicious xiao long bao. \xa0They take the the time to cook the dumplings well. \xa0Perfect amount of soup to meat ratio. \xa0Steamed dumplings were really good too with generous pork and shrimp filling.', ""Very grateful that we found this place. It's been a while since we've been to SD. You know, 2020 hasn't been kind to vacation plans. They accommodated our last minute online order with great hospitality and on top of that, the food was downright amazing. Their Xiao Long Bao is comparable to Din Tai Fung, honestly. The Shao Mai was also full of flavor. Their Chow Mein was a bit on the salty side (which I like), but I understand that that might not be the case for everyone. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try."", ""Came in without too many expectations but this place turned out pretty good! Many restaurants have their xiao long bao wrapper skin too thick and doughy, but it wasn't the case here. We also tried the potstickers (huge), the pan-fry buns and egg rolls. Everything was pretty decent and at a good price.I'll definitely be back for a quick lunch. My only complaint will be the portions - they come in pretty large quantities so there's no way you can order multiple items and finish them by yourself. For example, the pan-fry buns come in a minimum of SIX - who can eat that many??? I'd love for them to cut the quantities in half or offer a mix and match combo sort of deal."", ""Thought I'd give this place a shot because I didn't want to only depend on Din Tai Fung. I was pleasantly surprised!! The soup dumplings all had good shape and each one had an ample amount of soup within it!! The taste itself to me isn't as rich as DTF's but it is still pretty good! Totally worth the price. It's like $11 for 10, thats so worth. It's usually like that much or more for just 8 haha.I ordered on grubhub and it was packaged with red vinegar on the side. At first I was disappointed because I thought there was no ginger provided but its actually in the vinegar!""]"

Just the sandwiches and fries were more than enough for me to eat for two meals. I ended up saving the mac to eat later in the week since it was a huge portion. It was pretty standard but definitely looked made in-store, rather than being from a packaged mix. Lots of cheese. There were so many fries!

I loved the soft buns it came with and crinkle cut fries were nicely seasoned. It was so good, I got it again when I was craving for a spicy chicken sandwich.

Would definitely come back!"", ""No wait since I preordered through Yelp. We got there 10 minutes before the time window estimate they gave us and my order was already sitting on the counter resulting with my extra crispy fries being soggy.

Overall good spice flavor and I recommend my friends to try it. I think it's better than Dave's. Tips:Preorder on Yelp. I tried calling like what other reviews said and no answer. Get there before dinner time cause there was a line after usStart off with medium to gage their heat levels and adjust from there."", ""I'm actually mad about how good this place is. I live right down the street and it is dangerous knowing that delicious crispy chicken is just minutes away. Found this place just in time for summer...bye bye beach bod!

The previous two Hawaiian style eateries at this address didn't survive with the most recent one lasting maybe a year? Parking along Turquoise St is not easy to find, but if you are in and out quickly, you might be able to grab a spot across the street at the Gelson's lot.What I really liked about Homestyle is the ahi poke they served as their predecessors did not offer that item on the menu. Three styles were offered... Original, Spicy, and Kimchi. I chose the first one for my order. The special blend of seasonings used to flavor the tuna was perfect, and the fish was served on a bed of spring mix. One drawback was the very tiny area of available seating if you wanted to dine-in. That is a moot point nowadays so calling ahead for takeout is the best bet.

(we got a sour dough baguette ) and it was delicious to dip the bread into the soup. For a salad this time I got the chinese chop. Very good as well. Loved the miso dressing it came with and I honestly wouldn't change a thing. My friend got the super food and substituted the kale with mixed greens and her salad was just as good. The dressings make the salads better than most places. As previously mentioned they can appear to be a bit expensive but you get so much salad that it's enough for 2-3 meals honestly. It's worth the price and I'll be back again and again. Just wished I lived closer. \xa0I'd be here all the time.

Please consider updating your menu to include counts to help customers make choices that best align to dietary goals.', 'First time trying Mary\'s - I stopped in for lunch just now and am so glad I did! Both my partner and I ordered Summer Breeze salads and ate at a table out front. The service was excellent! Ivy rang us up and brought us our salads. She was so very kind and professional.I\'m not usually a salad person, but Mary\'s may change that. The ingredients in the Summer Breeze salads were totally fresh. One of my biggest beefs with salads is when the greens are too big and you have to stuff them in your mouth, not an issue here at all. Everything was perfectly bite-sized, and the ingredients were distributed evenly throughout the bowl. I loved the dressing - it added such a nice zesty flavor and there was a perfect amount of it. The combination of the greens, chicken, avocado and quinoa made it filling, and the salad was definitely ""meal-sized"".Thank you for the phenomenal service and salads, Ivy!', ""Always my favorite salad spot. It's right in La Jolla and super easy to get in and out of. This time I got the Summer Breeze and Harvest Cobb salads and they were amazinggggggg. The salads are a pretty big serving, definitely a meal. They can even toss the dressing for you. It only takes about 10 minutes from ordering to getting your salad. Also always order their lemonade and a cookie for an extra treat, you won't be disappointed!"", ""Don't know why I waited so long to give this little place a try. \xa0Delicious salads with lots of options. \xa0Prices are competitive with other area restaurants. Looks like it is all take-out, which is fine since we live in the area. \xa0We will definitely be back. \xa0Highly recommend."", ""I was intrigued by their salads and soups so I came in to check out the menu. There is a very nice and polite cute toy who works here. 15% off your order thanks to Yelp check in offer!! I'm also going to order fall spiced lemonade!"", 'Still the best salad in town! \xa0 A year later and everything is just as delicious, the quality has not wavered. \xa0Santa Fe, Summer Breeze, Kale Caesar, Thai Crunch and Super Food are my favorites. \xa0And love the new size option! \xa0Keep up the great work!']"

Very nice place to hangout with my friends. Food were really tasty and very nice design :) gonna come back if I have chance to visit San Diego again.', 'There are many pros and cons of \xa0this restaurant. Here is a little compilation from my recent experience.Pro:They have an extensive menu with vegetarian and vegan options.They have an amazing view of the cove: indoor and outdoor.Their food is very delicious. They have the more usual and common ""Japanese dishes"" as well as unique items. Again huge menu to choose from.They have happy hour and a great drink menu.Of course the cute character buns that have different filling based on the character.Cons:They do not take reservations. There is always a waitlist, and no, you cannot call into the wait list. The waitlist is usually at least an hour even after the usual lunch rush.Overall: Plan in advance. Don\'t show up thinking you will be seated shortly. Don\'t arrive too hungry or you will be hangry by the time you are seated. This place is a great experience. They have a beautiful spot near the water with a terrific view, and the interior is also very beautiful. Show up, check in, leave your phone number, and take a walk around the beautiful La Jolla village and cove. You wont regret it.', ""Severely disappointed by the food quality and lack of professionalism of this place. I decided to take my family from out of town here thanks to the raving reviews and attention this establishment gets on social media. However, I seriously regret that decision as not only was one meal out of the day affected, but the inattentive management and service resulted in our party being in the restaurant for OVER 3 hours and ruining the rest of our day's plans. Even more surprising was when I went up to go to the restroom, I realized just how many servers this restaurant had just been aimlessly walking around, on their phones, or goofing off to each other. All of this would be fine if there wasn't a crowd of people waiting outside with over half the restaurant practically empty, our food being delayed and cold, and it being a struggle just to find a waiter to come to the dining area just to ask for the bill.Furthermore the food was even more disappointing when it finally came out. We ended up trying each of the different bao buns and they all looked and tasted exactly the same. The character buns were even worse: The filling lacked any type of favor and were cold and hard by the time it arrived. Any other dishes we ordered were either too salty, doused in oil, or just plain unmemorable.If you are in the area and are looking for somewhere to eat, I highly recommend you avoid this place at all costs."", 'Came on a non-busy week day around lunch time and were told it was going to be a 30 min wait. That was alright for us since we were a pretty large party (around 8) and so we waited. This wait time also seemed to be the case for many despite party size. When we first began ordering the dining experience was fine. We accommodated greatly by our waiter who made sure to help us with dietary restrictions and such, but it was later on that this quickly devolved. The wait times for the food were long and the food was ultimately bland. Although the presentation was excellent, the food was so underwhelming and that our dining experience was negatively impacted. Our party actually was looking very forward to the Character Buns and the sushi which both seemed to have positive reviews but we were disappointed. The character buns, in my opinion, had little to no flavor and as an avid dim sum eater I could hardly call that the right filling for a bun. We also did not receive some of our orders and when we were able to catch the attention of a waiter (which was already difficult enough) we were informed that one of our orders was actually removed because of the dietary restriction. I am not sure if maybe this was due to miscommunication, but we were under the impression that the ingredient would just be removed or that we would be informed that it was not coming. Unfortunately, it was neither case and the food was just never going to come until we asked about it.What really took the cake, despite being underwhelmed with the food after all of the waits, was the time it took to flag a server. We spent at least 20 min trying to get their attention in order to get the bill and also to have the bill be paid. In total we arrived at 2PM, were seated at 2:30PM, and then were not able to leave until 4:45PM. It was an even greater shame because we actually are not from the area and the 2 hour car drive and hype around this restaurant just did not seem worth it.I think there are definitely places for improvement, but I \xa0personally would not be coming back to this location for a long time.', 'I really was excited to go to this new location in LA Jolla but ended up really disappointed. \xa0Let me start by saying I understand restaurants are having difficult times, but there is just some things that are not good.We first were seated in an area close to the water, but the floor was filthy and we were next to some stockpile of equipment. \xa0Ok I can forgive this if the rest was great, but it wasn\'t. \xa0When going over the menu with the waiter I specifically asked if there were sesame seeds or sesame oil in the soft shell crab bun. I had just had oral surgery and couldn\'t have seeds. He assured me it was oil. Buns came and I went to eat and my sons GF said don\'t eat it there are seeds! The waiter said they could make me another without seeds but it would take 1/2 an hour. So I made a choice and the waiter put in an order for eggplant buns.Sushi/sashimi came and it was ok. My son\'s duck Ramen never came. Took us about 20 mins to find our waiter. Once we did he went to find the Ramen. He came back and said they staff tried to send the Ramen outside 3 times...what??!? We sat there worrying that someone else had been with the Ramen.The check came and the soft shell crab that I couldn\'t eat was still on it. I spoke to the waiter and he said...""Normally, we leave it on there, but you guys are so cool I will remove it.""I paid over $200.00 for this dinner in La Jolla and it just wasn\'t worth it.', ""Sun, surf, & sushi. Can you think of a better combination? Cause I sure can't! And that's exactly what you get at the incredible Blue Ocean/Harumama! This was definitely one of the best meals I've ever eaten in my life. Blue Ocean/Harumama in La Jolla is truly an experience. Not only do they have some seriously killer views (peep that window seat ), but also an incredible menu! They've got damn near everything! Ramen, bao bao buns, steam buns, tempura, udon, sushi, and more!If you are ever visiting La Jolla, be sure to check this place out!"", ""Yelp must've mistaken this place for negative 4 stars. We were given a 30 minute wait time when there were over 10 tables open in the restaurant. Once being seated, we were practically waiting 15 minutes to to order our food while we saw around 10 waiters idling around. Each dish we ordered took just as much time to come out, which normally we would have been fine with, except for the food coming out practically cold and at staggering times.On top of that, we ordered the cute character buns and when we were given our food they did not meet any of our expectations. The insides were insanely bland which was a theme we noticed with the rest of the dishes we ordered. Either they came out tasting like nothing or like straight salt. We expected and waited for much more flavor than we were served.To make matters worse, \xa0we noticed that the table across us ordered the same exact thing but the presentation was different and their buns came out STEAMED. We're from out of town so it was really upsetting to receive this service."", ""Our friends recommended this place and we're so glad we checked it out! This was the first time since the pandemic happened that we dined in for ramen and takeout ramen does not compare to fresh ramen served hot to you. We got the fat duck ramen and the me so hot ramen. The duck chasu was so flavorful and juicy. The me so hot ramen came with brussel sprouts which was unusual for ramen but works so well. We don't usually rave about veggies but the brussel sprouts was so tasty and unique! The ramen were so much more enjoyable in person. Definitely enjoyed it piping hot and not having to assemble the ramen ourselves. We also got the character buns. They're so cute and tasty! The buns were soft and fluffy. We would want to come back to the restaurant for the nice views of the ocean and the great food. We sat outside and enjoyed watching the waves. Since this was a front row view of the coves, you might occasionally catch a sniff of the sea lions."", ""Beautiful beachside view of La Jolla. Parking was kind of a struggle but there is a $20 garage if you can't find street parking. We didn't have a reservation but the wait was only 20min and we spent it walking around La Jolla taking in the sights. We got a table right by the window overlooking the seals and beach. Service was friendly but a little slow. It took a while for us to get help and we kept having to wait for someone to walk past before we got any help. We ordered one of each of the character buns and the sweet ones (bunny, polar bear, koala) were the overall favorite. The savory ones were a little disappointing in flavor but we knew we were ordering mostly for the aesthetics. The bao baos however were phenomenal. The pork belly was so buttery and flavorful as well as the spam one. The coleslaw really melded the flavors together. As for entrees, we got the fat duck ramen and flying pig ramen. The flying pig was the richer broth out of the two and it came with the unorthodox Brussels sprouts which surprisingly complimented the pork very well. The fatduck melted in your mouth and I added extra ramen egg for more flavor."", 'This location is beautiful and the service is friendly! Since they don\'t take reservations, we waited 1 hour for patio seating. Even when we got back in time, we still had to wait another 30 minutes/the hostess might have forgotten us. FYI not everyone on patio seating will even get a good view of the beach. It\'s also quite chilly even in the summer, so come prepared!I\'ve tried the character buns before which are super cute! However, if you\'re going for taste, I\'d recommend getting the buns instead. The duck buns were a little too sweet. The nigiri was good, just not ""melt in your mouth"" as the other reviews had mentioned. The udon was much lighter than expected. Wish the sauce was thicker! My favorite was the new crispy pork belly appetizer. The restaurant has a sign in front that shows proper masking. There were one or two servers who weren\'t wearing their masks properly (not covering nose), which was actually pretty amusing. Would come here again for the views and aesthetic!']"

When I wrote the review it was flu season and I think I was just being overly cautious about everything. The workers were very careful about assembling your poke bowl. Anyways, the reason I rate it 3.5 stars and round it to four is because of the service! They are so nice and delivered excellent customer service! In my opinion, I feel that the size of the bowls are much smaller than I remember. I went here before when they first opened and the bowl I got the first time seemed bigger and I felt that I got more fish. Overall, a good poke place to try if you're in the area!""]"

After ordering three meals, the total came out to $36.57- which is quite the steal considering the portions were huge! The lamb chop and rouladen also came with a side of soup or salad (not pictured). I guess I'm used to overpriced LA meals, but the food did not disappoint either. The sausages and rouladen were very flavorful with just the right amount of saltiness. The lamb chop was seasoned well although it could be a bit more tender. Overall I am very glad I found this place especially at our peak hunger state. We devoured these quickly and even had some time to check out the grocery store connected to the restaurant, which was filled with lots of European goodies that you can't find in a regular grocery store. If you're ever at Carlsbad, whether for flower gazing or strawberry picking, this is definitely a food stop you should check out. You will not be disappointed nor leave hungry!"", ""Highly recommended! This is a very homey and authentic German restaurant.

This place beats almost any other German place I've been to in SoCal.My friends and I all ordered different items from the menu, and every single one of us were shocked by how good it was when he took our first bites.

That schnitzel was the juiciest schnitzel I've ever had, and the sauerkraut. Trust me, you've never had sauerkraut until you've had it from this place (unless you know, you're german).

In fact, they had a stream of customers come in and out constantly when we were there. However my two stars are based on the service that I received from one particular staff member.1. I checked in on Yelp and discovered there was a free drink. When I showed the person at the cash register he kept questioning me about it and even took the phone out of my hand with out my permission and started to scroll through my phone.2. I was paying with my credit card and the staff member said I needed to tap my card. I told him I didn't have a touch less card (My card has a chip) and he grabbed my card out of my hand and tried to tap it himself. 3. Since it was my first time ordering here, I asked how I would know when my order was ready. The person who took my order snapped at me and said to check back in 15 minutes. Additionally, the same person hovered over at the cash register/screen to see how much I was going to tip which really bothered me. Pros:-outdoor seating available in food court -free parking lot-yelp check in deal (can of soda)Cons:-terrible service-I didn't feel Covid safe here with the employee constantly grabbing my personal items (phone and credit card) without my consent"", ""5-29-21 For me the last night's meal where ever we visit needs to be special. \xa0Not necessarily fine dining or wickedly expensive, but memorable.This eatery is such a place. \xa0Serving only take out meals due to the on going Covid times.They must be making a killing. \xa0Their cooks are worth a gold mine. \xa0Every person I saw walked straight into this restaurant instead of any other restaurant in this so called Food Court which was more like a two story food mall. \xa0We saw the sign Food Court last nite then again today. \xa0It was a 3 minute walk from our hotel according to Yelp. \xa0From our hotel entrance it didn't look impressive but when we drove to it, my my, it was a food haven.I ordered the tandoori chicken, butter chicken, garlic naan and mango lassi.Their portions are so large. \xa0The naan was possibly a foot long, 2 pieces about a hand span wide. \xa0Tasty, soft and garlicky \xa0I shared some with Doc.The mango lassi was yummy and rich.I couldn't even touch the tandoori chicken or container of rice. \xa0I was stuffed. \xa0The butter chicken was savory in the most delicious sauce that had my pieces of torn naan going back for more til the morsels were gone. \xa0It hit the mark for being memorable.Customer service depends on who is at the register. \xa0The two gentlemen that helped me were excellent. \xa0The older man at the far right register was gruff and somewhat rude to a customer. \xa0I even heard another customer come out a little bit later saying the four letter word loudly and quite perturbed. Many customers both inside and out were of that culture or ethnicity so it was a dead giveaway that the food would be good and it was.Goodbye La Jolla, we shall return."", ""What looks like a stream of ants from a distance is a non-stop flow of people walking in and out of this restaurant collecting their takeout orders...Just in the area for a few hours and decided to get in a quick casual sit down dinner. Unfortunately, Yelp was off in that Charminar is still not seating people indoors but they do have some central tables outside in the shopping center where you can eat your food if you so choose. What I was not prepared for was how amazingly busy Charminar is. While standing in the restaurant, I placed my order online for my food because there's a coupon code they'll give you which you can save 10%-15% depending on the month. I was told the order would take about 25-30 minutes to prepare. This is not because my ordered items take that long to prepare, it's because their takeout orders are flowing so heavily, fast and free, even at 8:30 p.m. On the pickup table were 10 bags of orders awaiting pickup. While there 30 minutes, I'm sure at least 40 people went into the restaurant to pick up their orders. From the looks of things, I was the only non-Indian around. That was promising, my fingers were crossed for the food. Butter Chicken ($12.99) - Roasted chicken in bite torn pieces in a onion and tomato sauce cooked with fenugreek cream. Goodness... No wonder everyone comes here! The robust was sauce was the opposite of bland, it with tons of spices inside that had perfect melding of sweetness and creaminess and just enough of a spicy kick to get my blood flowing. This dish came with complimentary white rice. I loved this and can't wait to order it again!Garlic Naan ($2.99) - A good sized piece of garlic naan that was slightly on the softer side, medium thickness. It had good flavor but I would have loved it even more if it had a little more garlic and cilantro on it. Solid. I didn't order it this time, but I saw a lot of people leaving with cup of Mango Lassi.If you are in Mira Mesa and craving Indian food, definitely bookmark Charminar. The food here is better than many fancier Indian restaurants and houses one of the best Butter Chicken dishes I've had in SoCal."", ""2021/06/04 12:30Great Indian takeout. Their biryani is fantastic.We got the Vegetable Samosa, Vegetable Pakora, Garlic Naan, Hyderabadi Goat Dum Biryani, Paneer Butter Masala, Chicken Boti Kebab, and Mango Lassi. I placed the pickup order through ChowNow.Here are the highlights:- The Vegetable Pakora were small vegetable fritters. I couldn't tell what vegetables they're made of, and they weren't crispy at all despite being fried. I wouldn't recommend this.- Their Garlic Naan is yummy and fluffy, and it has a more mild garlic taste than garlic naan from other places.- The Chicken Boti Kebab was seasoned with lots of spices. It was slightly dry outside but soft and tender inside. - The Hyderabadi Goat Dum Biryani is only available on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. It's a huge portion of rice, spices, and tender chunks of goat meat layered together. It's spicy and delicious.- Their Mango Lassi is an bright shade of orange and has a strong taste of mango followed by the creaminess of yogurt."", ""The Family meal really can feed an entire family. Came here on a Saturday evening around 6 and ordered a family meal which came out to about $55 with tax. It includes the following and they let you pick! The price has gone up on the past few years, and still reasonable when you add up the individual items and how much you get. We ate for a couple days. Appetizer - fried cauliflower dish. I think it was called sizzling cauliflower and it was so good! Zesty and spicy sauce. Large family size Briyani - chicken. I was surprised there were multiple chicken drumsticks buried in my rice. Generous amount of meat, you just need to find it buried in the rice. Main Dish - Curry item. I got butter chicken and it hit the spot.  In addition to all of the above, you get an additional rice, two orders of naan, dessert and TWO MANGO LASSI!! Omg I loved the mango lasssi so so so much. Delicious bright orange drink. Because it was bright orange I thought it would taste fake but nope just like a ripe mango blended with yogurt. My food unfortunately took about 30 minutes to make, but they quoted 30 and it was ready on time. A suggestion would be to go ahead and order by phone or use their online ordering system, then you don't have to wait. Great they have an online system that doesn't upcharge customers. A couple areas for improvement that might help people who aren't super familiar with Indian food \xa0would be to label the extra items and sauces included for to go. Also perhaps maybe flag the tags to make sure drinks aren't forgotten. My precious mango lassi wasn't handed to me and I had to double check with the restaurant."", ""This is a great place for Biryani. I have tried most of the biryani's at this restaurant and the I am never disappointed because of the authentic Indian taste. Also, the chicken appetizers are super amazing. I haven't found such tasty Indian appetizers anywhere else in San Diego. Appetizers are a bit on the spicier side but you can always request for less spice. Must try appetizers: Chicken Majestic, Chicken Angara, Kodi Vepadu(super spicy)"", ""If you don't like sooo spicy (as me) Order the crispy cauliflower - you will not regret! The best! Crispy, sauce is perfect amount of spice - I could eat those the whole day! The Mango Lassi. The best Mango Lassi of my life!!! If you like spicy (as my husband) order the Chicken Ancara - he looooves spicy and he was in heaven!Our first time here and I can't wait to try the whole menu!

The owners are really nice and work so hard to give everyone a good experience that I always think of them first when deciding where to go for dinner.

I was interested in trying the breakfast baos.On one fine Saturday, we arrived before 11am and tried to order the breakfast combo and the gentleman behind the counter told us it wasn\'t available. \xa0I was perplexed because it was before 11am. \xa0So I tried to break it down, what wasn\'t available? \xa0I asked, do you have vietnamese iced coffee?

I don't venture out this way very often, it's mainly residential homes here. This is the only strip mall in the area. I'm glad my friend told me about this little banh bao shop. The original locations are in OC. We decided to order a mix of savory and sweet options. They offer vegetarian and seafood bao options as well. Their cha gio or egg rolls also come in meat or vegetarian options. I was told to skip the tarp buns they are not very sweet for flavorful. The custard buns are the sweet ones to get. I also ordered their vegetarian, seafood (recommended) pork quail egg sausage, pork regular egg sausage, pork salted egg sausage (highly recommend). They offer breakfast bao's if prefer something in the morning. Coffee and smoothie bar options for drink. The buns come cold but you can ask them to heat it for you if you plan on eating right away. It's about 30-40 seconds per bun depending on your microwave. They pack all the buns in a single container but have it neatly labeled for you. You can order individual or by boxes of 9. If you really like a certain bao just get a box. You can freeze these up to 6 months! Overall, I really enjoyed these banh bao. Main reason is the freshness of the bao, I've had others where the bao is super dry and tough. The filling is lacking flavor or just not there at all. These were soft and fluffy. They don't skimp on the filling. They also make fresh sheltered dry pork! If you don't know what I'm talking about I'll post a picture. It's really good here, it's fresh and not dried out. It comes in two sizes $5.50 small and $11 for the large. That's a steal! Check them out!"", ""Perfect place to get my Vietnamese banh bao cravings. While there are no baos better than my mom's homemade, these are close. Lots of variety. The dough is soft and filling to dough ratio is on point. Filling is flavorful. We got five kinds to try and all were great. Loved the Original Pork, BBQ Pork Buns and Egg Custard Bun. Also was pleasantly surprised by Chicken with Salted Duck Egg Bun, which was really good and moist. They even have durian egg custard buns if you fancy durian, which I love!"", ""Do NOT order the Thai tea or anything with boba. Their boba is not the fresh boiled kind. The boba tastes like it came out of a can. The Thai tea itself tastes extremely sour and spoiled. I thought it was just a bad experience but I've ordered twice now and it's been this way both times.But the bao buns are amazing!"", ""If you haven't had the baos from TP, you're def missing out! Excellent meat to dough ratio (mostly meat) and 100% packed with flavor! Bread isn't dry and you can smell the delicious aroma right as you open the box!$10 for a box of 9 or $25 for 3 boxes of 9. My biggest regret was not going for the 3 boxes from the beginning! Looking forward to trying some of their other baos but if they're anything like the pork and egg, then I'm sure I won't be disappointed!"", ""Great buns, great drinks. A little dry on the buns from time to time, but most of the time it's pretty good and juicy, definitely the best place in town.They also make the food super fast if you're in a rush, and they label each bun on the package so you know which is which."", 'Such a hidden gem. \xa0Extremely well made bao buns. \xa0Many types to chose from. \xa0They have breakfast and coffee. \xa0We had the bbq pork and it was amazing.', ""This is where you need to go if you're craving for Vietnamese style baos. They have so many different options- from seafood, vegetarian, chicken, and pork.I've only had the original pork steamed buns, which come with regular egg and sausage. These are quite tasty and the perfect little snack. I have yet to try their drinks, but am looking to get their bbq pork buns next time I'm craving for banh bao."", ""SO GOOD! I can't wait to come and buy more togo. The owner was super nice, introducing all the flavors to us and explaining how the boxes are priced and sold. She also provides typed up instructions on how to reheat the buns properly. We got some #1 warm, and some cold taros and custards to heat up on our own. I loved all of them! I don't know what spices they put in their filling, but pork in the #1 was sooo flavorful. The taro was thick, and perhaps a tad dry but I didn't mind it at all. The custard was wetter and creamy. The white buns on all of them were the same: fluffy and tasty. 10/10 recommend!""]"

They have captain crunch, oreos, fruit pebbles and a few other toppings you can get. If you don't choose from one of those, you can have a slice of fresh strawberry or macaroon. You could also get a regular taiyaki with Nutella, red beans, or custard. Haven't tried that, but I'm sure it is good as the breading on the ice cream was delicious."", ""Food:They sell one dessert, and do so really well - as in they perfected their recipe. It's soft serve ice cream - smooth, creamy, and offered in a variety of flavors (albeit rotating) - and tayaki, which is a fish-shaped pastry with filling - again, offered in a variety of flavors and textures. Once you select your ice cream (can be single flavor or swirling two flavors) and filling, you can select from a decent amount of toppings - Oreo, different cereals, etc. Lastly you can top the toppings with a macaron. Sometimes, we order just the ice cream or just the tayaki for a smaller snack as well.Service:Friendly staff. Desserts came out looking nice. They were also generous to offer free desserts to health care workers in 2020!Atmosphere:Not much room inside to eat, so during the pandemic and even before, we ate our dessert elsewhere. They have a simple layout - concise menu, open area to watch the staff pour your soft serve, cook your tayaki, and add the toppings."", ""SomiSomi is located on Mira Mesa Blvd. next to Pho Cao Cali.

She sold us out of the takoyaki, thus settling for a swirl.I know there are other SomiSomi locations in SoCal so I'd love to come back and get a plain swirl without the toppings."", ""Located in the same plaza as Pho Cow Cali, Autozone, Bank of America, etc. Parking is sometimes limited during rush hour, but there tends to always be parking around the bank area. Workers are all very nice here. Always a great place to come for some soft serve or taiyaki! The soft serve never disappoints and is always the right sweetness. I love mostly all the flavors: ube, matcha, black sesame, milk tea, oreo, etc. The Taiyaki's come in various flavors. My favorite is Custard and Oreo. Soft and chewy on the inside and crispy on the out. Great place to get a quick dessert fix!"", ""YEEEESSS MY FRIENDS. YESSS. Ugh. What a treat!!!! The soft serve is so creamy and refreshing. Full of wonderful flavor ...and the CONES! I am a sucker for Nutella filled but my boyfriend always goes for the red bean. Never ever been disappointed here. Each time I enjoy it as if it's my first time here. Flavors rotate monthly which is awesome if you want to try something new, I just wish the green tea was a staple flavor because the swirl with that and the milk is my jam!!!!!"", ""Best ice cream I've ever had!!

They don't have a ton of options but there are definitely a good amount of combinations to try and that allows them to do it well"", 'I got the Ahboong Ube & Oreo Swirl with custard filling. There was very little custard in the taiyaki to the point where I could not taste it at all when I was eating it. I usually go to the Convoy one and they give a lot more filling and ice cream swirl. Taste wise, the Ube & Oreo Swirl was delicious, especially the cookies and cream toppings I got on it was a great compliment to the dessert. The two different flavors mixed well together, you can taste the sweetness of the oreo swirl without losing any of the flavors from the Ube.

The gosh waffle filled with Nutella and cookies and cream was SO good! However, the service was absolutely horrible. The girls working that night were extremely rude and asking them a basic question seemed like a huge pain to them. I had noticed it with the lady ordering before us and thought maybe she had been rude to them prior to us walking in or something but nope, they were rude during our turn and the guy behind us. But, I came to get ice cream and it was good so still overall 4 stars. Will I be back... probably not...', ""Traveled up from Phoenix and Somi Somi is a must-stop of you live for desserts!

It was the best solution on a hot summer day!"", ""This was my first time ever trying SomiSomi because I am a dinosaur and slow to jump onto the bandwagon in my old age. But I digress. Service was sweet and friendly and when I asked the gal what she liked, she suggested the ube ah-boong filled with cream. Tasty! The co-habby had a few bites because he has to watch his sugar intake but he gave it a thumbs up. I appreciated the mask-enforcing and limiting people inside for the safety of their staff and customers so there may be a line. However, \xa0you don't wait long as they serve up their treats quickly. They offer a variety of toppings such as oreo crumbs, cotton candy crunch and other cereal type garnishes for your ah-boong if you so desire. Next time I'll try a milktea with coconut flakes as the gal before me had bought.I read some of the other reviews and saw how they at one point were giving out free ice cream to our front line workers last summer which was sweet.

I didn't try the other two rolls but James didn't complain about them so I guess they were ok. Overall, that gross tasting lemon/fish were enough for me to say I am not going to order sushi from here anymore.""]"

One of my favorite dessert places to go to in SD', ""I must say, I wanted to come here SEVERAL times. Twice I went while they were still closed in the late mornings etc. It's a bit out of the way from where I live.I was so excited to finally stop in on my way home one day and I was pretty disappointed. The churros were crunchy and tasted cheap. I love a crunchy but soft on the inside churro but I'm not sure if they were over cooked but they were more of a cracker. I have had much better. My husband loved the churromisu ice cream, but also said the churro itself wasn't that great. We let them soak in the ice cream and it helped but not enough to wow. I had also ordered just churros and I ended up throwing them away.I LOVE a good churro, I'm known to drive down the Las Americas outlets for the churro stand they have there which is 35 min away from me-I WILL go where the yummy churros are. I might try again to come back if I'm in the area and see if maybe I just had a bad bunch. But I'm not going out of my way to try it again."", ""I love churros and I love ice cream, so I was excited to try this spot. It was a bit disappointing though. We walked in and the guy working definitely did not look like he wanted to be there. He had zero customer service at all. We wanted to create our own churro/ice cream cup. The steps are laid out on the menu screen but there was no info about what type of designer churros or toppings they had. He pointed out to the sign of designer churros on the side wall like we were stupid! We had never been there before so how would I know they were listed on a separate wall? The toppings were also located at the other side of the counter, but barely filled and without labels, so it was hard to tell what they even had. The ice cream was good once you got down to eat under the thick layer of Oreo crumbs (no Oreo cookie chunks, just crumbs..) and Nutella. The churro itself was not crunchy like a churro, tasted more like a fried donut. \xa0It was nothing special and doesn't compare to other well-known churro spots like The Loop. The customer service also made the dessert taste way worse."", ""I've had 3TEN Churrobar bookmarked for a long time now and I finally got dessert here a few weeks ago with some friends one evening.Indoor dining is closed, but they've set up a few tables and chairs outside.I got the Campfire which is pretty much s'mores. It has vanilla ice cream, a churro, chocolate sauce, graham cracker and a torched marshmallow. It was good however the torched marshmallow had a strong gasoline taste lol. Too bad, because that's my favorite part of S'mores. Aside from that, the dessert was pretty tasty and I'd still get it again. Maybe I'll just ask for the marshmallow untorched next time."", 'Friday 2020/10/23 19:00I checked out this place for some dessert after eating dinner nearby. The place was quite empty and quiet, and there was only one person there to man the cashier and make the desserts. Being pretty full, I just got one of their designer churros, the Chocolate Marshmallow Graham.The churros were made ahead of time and were resting on a rack. It seems that all the designer churros are all made with just the one base churro. For toppings, there was a chocolate sauce, graham crumbs, and a marshmallow drizzle.I wish the churro was warm, as fresh churros are, and it was a little stale, probably from sitting there for a little while. It still tasted great with the toppings, but I would rather go somewhere that serves up fresh-fried churros.', ""Finally got to swing by and check this place out, the art inside was cute and was clean as well, even though indoor eating isn't allowed right now during the pandemic.I was really excited to have the campfire but was disappointed I didn't get my roasted marshmallow as I should have! They were out of unicorn but made it close enough for my daughter to not know the difference. The cotton candy ice cream they put in hers was surprisingly good that my hubs and I were eating some of hers. My husband got cookies and cream one, he liked his as well. I was the only one that wasn't satisfied with mine, the vanilla bean ice cream was meh for campfire, seemed like it was missing something and just wasn't doing it for me. Will have to try again hoping for a better result next time."", 'When you see people post on the gram its a habit to bookmark. Made sure before I leave to stop and get me some dessert. Easy to choose from or make your own.', ""I came in after my lunch because I just wanted to try this place out for dessert. \xa0At first I wanted the Apple of my Eye Churro & Ice Cream, but they didn't have caramel apple, so I got the Churromisu ($7.95 for full size) instead. \xa0I was kind of put off by it because it was about 1 when we came in, which should be around the time when you would think people would be coming in because it's after lunch time, when I would expect the peak time would be, yet they still don't have all the ingredients.The full size is probably best to split between 2-3 people, and the half size is a comfortable size for one person. \xa0The ice cream is pretty basic, but really what do you expect, they're not know for their ice cream. \xa0Their churros are pretty good though. \xa0They're more light and flaky rather than dense and doughy like most other churros that I'm used to. \xa0They don't use any dairy free ice cream, but you could still try out the churros individually with various toppings and syrups. \xa0Really the thing to experience here are obviously churros so you don't need to have it with the ice cream. \xa0I feel like the prices are reasonable, so it's a nice place to stop by after a meal for some dessert. \xa0I really want to try out the Campfire Churro and Ice Cream, so if I'm ever in the area again and wanting some dessert, I'd come back here for that."", ""Unique combination of ingredients, great presentation, decent ice cream. The churro was good too but I really was expecting it to be more unique or have more selection of churros since they are a Churrobar. It honestly tasted like any other churro I've ever had which doesn't mean it's bad but I kind of had higher expectations for this place. Overall I'd give it 3.5 stars but it was satisfying so I can't complain too much haha.There was a very long wait though, and it seemed like only 1 person was working. I used to work at an ice cream shop so I know the struggle. I'd advise the employer to staff a bit better, the guy seemed really stressed out and was rushing even to get everyone's order. It'll make your business run smoother and your employees happier if you overstaff. I hated working at the ice creamShop for that reason, take care of your peeps!"", ""More like 3 8's. The hype in my opinion isn't legit.This place puts an honest attempt to provide good desserts at reasonable prices but their process is painfully slow.Tried them once during their soft opening then again a new months later. \xa0Unfortunate, same operational lacking.The layout of the place is all wrong in my opinion and it lacks organization. \xa0It is clean though. \xa0They do offer adult sized games which is cool but it is in anticipation and acknowledging they are slow and customers will wait a while. The churros are good but most people trying this place for the first time don't even have a clue of what to order which makes the wait time even longer.By the time you get your order, good luck trying to find a place to sit. \xa0Both times my wife and I took it to go and enjoyed our churros in the car on our way home. Costco is good enough for me- in terms of price and flavor wise. \xa0Probably because I'm simple folk.""]"

This last time, the meats were extremely dry and the rice was flavorless. We called to let them know our experience and the owner told us to come back and receive a replacement platter, free of charge. They apparently had a change in staff that cause the discrepancy in their normal quality. Despite this last trip, there is no way I can give them anything less than 5 stars.

No one was at the counter. Then the gentleman said ""she"" will be right there to help you. It definitely seems to be mom&pop shop so I think ideally any of you should be there to greet the customer. I was definitely willing to pass this and not be bothered by it. Till I got home and checked my food and was hoping the quality of the beef kebab be as they promote it to be. Now I\'m not very picky when it comes to food and I know an amazing kebab, from a great kebab, a good one or a very bad one. This was by far one of the worst Kebabs I\'ve ever had in this country. Why you ask? It\'s because it was FILLED with fat to a point that you could smell it off of the plate. I really don\'t like to waste food but I was debating if I should just throw this into trash. Ultimately, I poured a big load of somac on it to make it at least a bit tolerable. The chicken kebab was OK and I could tell it might have been seasoned for a very long time. So pretty much nothing seemed fresh here. Im going with 3 stars rather than one because they have put effort in preparing the food and I respect their hard work. After all, it is a family business so we have to be mindful of that. I hope things change a bit at this place and they start using more quality ingredients. I don\'t mind paying extra for quality.', ""Ever since they've renovated their dining room, it's been uncomfortable walking in there and difficult to order.

So if you can finally get your order from them, kudos to you!"", ""I've been here maybe 20 times now. The food is always great. Never had a customer service issue. It can be a little slow sometimes but that's because the bolani takes time to make. This time I figured I would call ahead for a pick up. That was the way to go for sure.I got alot of food, enough for 3 and we had leftovers. Biryani Goat is delicious. Nice soft goat meat and it has that good goat/lamb type flavor. The rice it comes with makes the meal perfect. It's long grain rice with whole spices cooked into it (cumin, cardamom, and clove). Gives it a great flavor.The potato bolani is always delicious. Basically a flatbread with potato and herbs mixed inside it. Delicious plain or when you dip it into the afghani style tzatziki. Gyros are huge and very good. The meat is cut thicker than other places. They have alot of veggies on it and that tzatziki sauce. Over all delicious. This place is inside a halal grocery store that sells meat and a bunch of other stuff. Highly recommend the Afghani candy they sell by the register. Homemade soft jelly rolls with pastachios inside. Almost like a Turkish delight but with nuts."", ""Not so clean.

Wholesome, fresh, plentiful and healthy meal. This is a hidden gem in Mira Mesa."", ""I wasn't sure what to expect but the reviews looked good. After eying the menu for what seemed to be an uncomfortable amount of time, I decided on the gyros salad. And if I hadn't see some other posters comments I wouldn't have known you can get it spicy if you ask. For hot heads like me, get it. I ordered mine to go so when I got home and opened it up I was a little dismayed that the lettuce was iceberg instead of romaine which I get at every restaurant I go to. Is iceberg lettuce a deal killer? Well, I was pleasantly surprised, no scratch that, I was amazed by how flavorful the gyros were. And with that spice. Oh my. I'll definitely be back."", ""Wow. Super amazing good food! Pros: -Piping hot, crispy samosas (with lots of hot filling too) -Amazing combos and meat quality! -Really moist chicken shwarma/chicken in general (The wrap was only $7-8?

Cons:-Under renovations right now so we weren't able to access a menu that easily, but the workers were super nice and tried to be as accommodating as they could be. -A little disorganized but that's okay, the food was so bomb I honestly didn't mind waiting for it"", ""Uuuuuuugh-mazing!I can't believe I haven't been to this place sooner. What a wonderful hole in the wall this place is. Food was delicious and the owner was so nice to us. Don't come here if you're looking for fancy because it is not. It's a family ran business and I absolutely love that! Easy and simple menu and definitely affordable.We ordered Combo 2, Chives Bolani and a Gyro wrap. All was great.

But we had read great things on Yelp so we decided to try it out anyway. The Beef Kabob was a lot dryer than I expected. I have never tried Afghan food before so maybe this is how it should be? I've had very similar dishes in Persian restaurants and the beef has always been very juicy so I expected this dish to be the same :-( The Kofta Chalow was packed with flavor and much much juicier than the kabob. I recommend trying this one! It was unlike any flavors I had before but it was pretty delicious :-) Both dishes came with rice and flatbread.

Jaunt offers an array of baked goods, acai bowls, burritos, and espresso without anything ever being too under-seasoned, over-roasted, or cloy. in the past they offered indoor seating but due to obvious safety protocols that's being put on hold. in the meantime, you can snag a seat under their outdoor canopy.i would recommend: ANY of the cold brew options, caramel black salt latte, cold brew mojito, or cortados. i'd advise not to order the ceremonial matcha as i'm convinced it's not ceremonial at all, just sencha ;) the particular matcha here lacks the vibrancy + frothiness of the Japanese equivalent and has a rather extremely artificial taste and sandy texture; which leads me to assume a sencha green tea powder or bancha (tea leaves+stems harvested in late summer/early fall) is used instead (also evident in the black particles on the bottom of the cup). staff is typically friendly on most days, paul and christian always serving coffee with warm attitudes. only downside is they close so early; M-F 630a-2p, S 7a-2p, SU 7a-130p. check it out and browse the other businesses surrounding the block also!"", ""I'm a self-proclaimed coffee snob and this place is one of favorite local coffee shops in San Diego!!!

When we got there at 10:30am, there's only one empanada flavor left - ham & cheese, luckily I got one, because when we left, all the empanadas were gone. I tried their Ube Malasada which is a type of Hawaiian donut. It's more fluffy and stuffed than a donut. I loved it!!!! I also love their coffee, I had a cappuccino this time~ they made it beautiful. I had a bag of their coffee beans before, I enjoyed it. I will go back for more pastries in the future, and of course more coffee."", 'Wow i love this place!!! The employees were very friendly and accommodating, answering any questions you would have. There is something for everyone on the menu whether it be drinks or food.

My breakfast burrito was still cheesy and delicious though :) and i drank my latte so quickly, it was just so good!!! It was perfectly sweet and not bitter. I cant wait to come back here!!!

Came here bc Split makes these special for Jaunt Coffee roasters, I'd make the drive again to eat this.Ordered vanilla hazelnut latte and it was beautiful and delicious. The beans were $22 (on the pricier side), but service was 10/10 and coffee and food hit the spot. They were busy so we couldn't get seating outside under their tent.

They're in an industrial complex on Miralani Dr. that is home to artisan brewers & roasters. \xa0Easy parking in the lot (though the spaces are a bit close together).The guys here know a ton about coffee - not your average barista! I skipped the mint mojito coffee (black + house mint syrup) in favor of a good old fashioned cold brew. They use Brazilian beans and it was very delicious. \xa0I also *love* that they have a program where you can buy a cup of coffee for someone who's out of work and pay it forward; they leave a stickie someone can use if they need to caffeinate but are out of $$ that day!It looks like their flavored lattes etc. are what get many people to come here, but I appreciate their single-origin coffees with clear tasting notes on the bags - and their understanding the difference between Latin American and African/Indonesian coffees!"", ""I was in Mira Mesa last weekend and needed a coffee fix while my friends slept in. I headed over to this place - it's very unassuming, in a small business park area of Mira Mesa. Don't be fooled - the coffee is DELICIOUS. Artisan, strong, creamy, and nutty. It was so good. I got the iced lavender latte and I loved it. The lavender was a perfect floral complement to the roast of the beans. I also got the Caramel Black Sugar iced latte for my friend, and 2 vanilla lattes, and I heard back that they were delicious as well. I also snagged a goat cheese and mushroom empanada - still warm and flakey! Very delicious and the perfect light breakfast snack if you're like me and just want to grab a small bite in the morning."", ""My guy found this on Yelp, and we stopped in for a quick morning coffee date before we headed to Julian/Ramona for the day. Jaunt Coffee Roasters is located in the industrial section of Miramar. It's easy to miss. Surprisingly there were a lot of people there for a Saturday morning.Upon entering, I saw a board posted up on their wall with post-it notes for pre-paid coffee as a pay-it-forward kind of thing. I thought that was really cute and sweet.I got the iced lavender latte and a ham & cheese empanada. Everything tasted great! Indoor seating is closed for the time being but they did have a few tables and chairs set up outside.""]"

The ""marinated"" mushrooms were not even salted. Even the mozarella cheese had no flavor! The bread was also criminally bad. It was a bit stodgy and underbaked, and tastes only like dough because there doesn\'t seem to be any salt in it whatsoever. The only thing that had flavor in the sandwich was the sundried tomatoes and it couldn\'t save it. I had to dip it in the salad dressing for it to have any taste at all.Today my company decided to buy food from Urbane again. The salad was tastier, but while today\'s foccacia is not underbaked, it\'s still the same doughy, flavorless stuff.

For my first time here, I went with the Santa Maria BBQ chicken salad and my friend got the Chimichurri Steak sandwich. 1) Santa Maria BBQ chicken salad Nice and clean salad mix with purple cabbage that comes with black beans, roasted corns, and crumbled goat cheese. It also comes with a piece of bread, which I'm assuming it's their focaccia bread that was nice and soft. I personally enjoyed it and for $10, I would get it again. However, the only thing I didn't care for was their chipotle dressing, but loved their blackberry bbq drizzle! I would probably just sub the dressing out for more drizzle next time.2) Chimichurri Steak sandwichIt comes with a side house salad, just typical. In regards to the sandwich, it was really skimpy on the meat. Also, based on their website, I believe it was supposed to come with steak strips, but instead it was like shredded meat mixed with sauce.

The food is delicious, cheap, and healthy. The prices are so good it literally reminds me of a small town midwestern restaurant. Under $9 for most things. Also love the decor, bright and cheerful.

Today, in particular, I ordered their Tofu Banh Mi sandwich with side salad and a double chocolate cookie. Their Banh Mi, of course, has their own Urbane twist but the pickled veg and perfect Urbane bread is what brings it together. Their tofu was pressed to perfection!! Wowie. Every vegetable in my plate was fresh and not wilted so I appreciate the quality check. I always love their balsamic vinaigrette and save some to dip my bread in. Their cookies are warm and nothing is better than a homey tasting cookie, especially in these rough days.I ordered through their app and picked up for takeout.

I personally wasn't the biggest fan of the Chimichurri sandwich, it was slightly bland for my liking but the house salad comes with a dressing option (I don't remember the exact one I got but it was like a cilantro dressing) and it helped make the sandwich a lot more flavorful. If you're looking for something with a kick I would definitely recommend the Cilantro Torta, it was super yummy and I would get it again.

It adds some crazy cool texture and flavor--I found out recently that there are others who request this customization as well.You can make your banh mi into a combo for a couple bucks more, which includes a couple of egg rolls and a canned drink. It's a pretty tasty deal.This small shop also offers an assortment of pre-made sides that pair well with their banh mi. I usually go with spring rolls, sticky rice or steamed peanuts.The sides are decent, but not always better than what you will find at restaurants, partly because they are not made to order and most Vietnamese cuisine includes fresh ingredients that are best served immediately after it is made.They also sell party trays and snacks here, but honestly I come here for my #5 and some premade sides. I used to order drinks from here, which are decent, but \xa0I am trying to limit my sugar intake now a days so no more drinks for me.The only knock I hear every so often is that they use hougie bread (looks kinda like Subway plain bread) rather than more traditional baguettes for their banh mi. My response is that my experience is that the bread served here is consistently fresh and perfectly toasted, unlike other banh mi joints that will still peddle crumbly old baguettes that are hard to bite into.Prepandemic, there was limited seating indoors, with a least one table outside.So swing by this cute little shop, order a banh mi combo and a side to enjoy. Cheers!"", ""I have been in this plaza many times and for some reason I've never tried this place. There is always a lot of parking and it is a small place, mainly to go. Service was fast and good. We really liked the BBQ pork sandwich, we also ordered the sausage sandwich and it was good but nothing special. I would say the sandwich size is a little smaller than their competition."", ""Love this spot. No frills delicious banh mi, spring rolls, party trays, Vietnamese coffee, shrimp chips. My go to is the BBQ pork or a breakfast sandwich.Super fast and easy standard prices. There's a $5 minimum on credit cards and they are closed Mondays."", ""Vietnamese sandwich shop located in Mira Mesa next to Big Lots. They sell party trays of popular Vietnamese dishes in addition to their Banh Mi offerings.I came in here for a quick dinner last night. I wanted something quick and fast. I ordered a Banh Mi Thit Nuong (BBQ Pork Sandwich) $5.25. It was pretty good, it was made nice and fresh. In addition to the BBQ pork, the sandwich also had cucumber, daikon, and cilantro. I usually don't like vegetables but everything was tasty and refreshing. Nice place to get your Banh Mi fix!"", ""Absolutely my favorite Vietnamese snack and breakfast stop! Love all their goodies that are made fresh in the morning!!! Sticky rice with chicken and Taiwanese sausages are bomb! Spring rolls with shrimp and veggies are so fresh! We tried their banana leaf with shrimp and this was bomb!I love their banh loc with shrimp super chewy and delicious! Egg rolls are delicious as well! I must say, try everything and you'll be in for a treat!!"", ""COVID EDITIONOne of the staples in Mira Mesa for banh mi! I've lived in the neighborhood for more than 25 years & as long as I can remember from my childhood, my family has only ever gone here for banh mi!! (Although I'm not sure how long they've actually been around haha)Due to covid, they don't have any indoor dining, but that's okay because sandwiches travel well for takeout. They also do party trays for different dishes, have smoothies and use fresh fruit, and have various foods out on the counter to buy too like sesame balls, spring rolls, etc.Great family business to support with amazing banh mi !"", ""The sandwiches are always fresh and the condiments are also very good. They also have side dishes that you can purchase thats made daily on top of the counter or in the refrigerator section. They also have delicious boba drinks in many flavors. Friendly and fast. I'm not sure if they are allowing people to eat inside now as they have a few tables inside."", 'Great banh mi spot in San Diego!!! My go-to order is the grilled pork sandwich Thanks, Bale!', ""Always get my Banh Mi Tit Nuong AKA Bbq pork viet sandwich fix here. Their meat isn't tough like some other places and their bread is delicious. The same girl always takes my order and is always super sweet.BF's family constantly caters from here. Lemongrass chicken is good. I haven't had anything I didn't like from here.Gotta support my local family businesses!""]"

No waiting at all. Great. Went home and opened the bag. Pakora was stinking and was soft. Not at all crispy. Couldn\'t stand the smell. Trashed it. Next, onto the lamb curry and Naan. Where do I even begin with the lamb ""curry""? \xa0if I can even call it a curry that\'s being very generous with this review. OK are you ready? Lamb dipped in hot oil. No salt and no spices. Lamb pieces mostly fatty. WTH was this? In my 10 years of living in Sandiego, being an Indian and having tried out various Indian cuisines THIS HAS GOTTA BE THE WORST EVER!!! Their idea of a lamb curry is to cook lamb separate, heat only oil in a pan and then pour it to a cup and then finally put the cooked lamb pieces in the cup of hot oil. OMG I was so frustrated that I wanted to call them to pay me back my money for this disaster of Indian food. Finally the naan was nothing short of an elastic or rubber foam. Guys...atleast the Indian folks... please ..if you dont trust me order their lamb curry and tell me something is wrong with my review. As for the local Americans.... cant blame your 3 or 4 or even 5 star ratings but you guys need to know that THIS IS NOT INDIAN OR PUNJABI FOOD. Tasteless food is the last thing Indians are used to.

The combo also came with rice and a side of garlic naan. The garlic naan was nice and chewy. You can either use the naan as a wrap to eat with your dish or simply dip the naan into your curry spice sauce. I tried both ways and I prefer to dip the naan in the sauce.

Definitely will be back!', ""This place used to be my favorite and whenever I'd crave some yummy Indian food. This was a gem. Unfortunately, if you're chewing and you get a sand-like crunch, it's probably dirt and mud from the floor. They probably store food on the floor as well, knowing every bite was very sandy. This isn't the first time it's happened either, normally I'd ignore it if it was a little, but every bite was atrocious. The flavor is amazing, just wish it was a little more sanitary): Maybe I will give it a second chance down the road, but for right now.

Wish the curry here were spicy but they were on the way milder side than I thought. Vindaloo seemed like they used dairy so I was a bit thrown off by the creaminess of the curry. Overall, a good inexpensive Indian fix.', 'This is my favorite spot!!!

I lived in the PNW for four years and I came to realize that there definitely WERE a good amount of teriyaki restaurants, even in the small capitol city of Oregon. I'm glad that Bowl to Go can scratch that itch for some of y'all. Bf has wanted to try this place out and I never would've if it wasn't for him. Definitely a good little hidden gem out in Miramar in the same plaza as Pauly's Pizza Joint. We got the combo plate with chicken/beef and the bulgogi bowl. I have a smaller appetite so I had the bowl. Both dishes were seasoned very well and had that lovely mild char on the meat. The combo plate also came with a little bit of a cabbage slaw in vinaigrette, which was nice. Only gripe is that the beef in the combo plate was a little bit tough. Overall, I'd ditch the mall teriyaki and would hit up this very nice, clean mom and pop with friendly service."", ""Yes! The search is over! Let me start by saying that I'm originally from Seattle, home of amazing teriyaki on nearly every corner, and I have been searching for a suitable substitute in San Diego for years. I happened to be driving down Miramar a few months ago and noticed the sign that said teriyaki. I immediately came home and searched Yelp to find this spot. I needed to know if it was going to be comparable to Seattle teriyaki. I discovered three other Yelpers who mentioned Seattle in their review and gave it a thumbs up as being close to what we know in the Northwest as good teriyaki. It took me a couple months to make my way here because the hours aren't great. Like most of Miramar restaurants, they're mainly open during work hours to cater to the business crowds. They close too early in the evenings to plan a dinner here and they're not open past lunch on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays. It's worth the effort to find time to come though. I will definitely be making this a regular stop!The teriyaki sauce is spot on! Thick and sweet and delicious! I couldn't get enough and dumped an extra helping on top of my already soaked beef and chicken. I'm not sure I'd be able to tell the difference between this one and one from Seattle. It was that good! Even the minimalist decor reminded me of the simple Seattle teriyaki shops. Their menu is small but I've always felt that the best teriyaki shops are the ones with basic menus. The teriyaki here is light years better than any Japanese restaurant that serves sushi and better than Surf Brothers, which was the only thing I knew of that was close to teriyaki before but never quite the same. I will be back and I will be spreading the word to anyone who has had the pleasure of eating Seattle teriyaki and misses it in San Diego."", ""Love the chicken bowl...

The prices were very affordable, and the menu selection was rather simple, both of which made this business popular with the students. They only had nine tables inside for seating and a couple outside the front door. A bonus to this place was the free carafe of self-service hot tea and cups provided at each table.Back when they first opened, most of the sushi rolls came as six pieces and cost between $2.75 and $3.50. They were not large, but they shouldn't be with such budget conscious prices. No special maki rolls were listed on the menu. I chose a spicy onigiri (triangular shaped rice wrapped with seaweed), Seattle roll (salmon, avocado, cucumber), spicy tuna roll, and broiled eel roll for my meal. My favorite was the onigiri which had spicy tuna stuffed inside the rice. Not many places serve onigiri so that made the item even more intriguing. Upon their closure, a Korean fried chicken business has now taken over the suite."", 'Being named after my most favoritest of Samurai: Miyamoto Musashi, my expectations were high. And that\'s tempered against the fact that it\'s smack dab (smack dab? WTF\'s that mean?) in the middle of La Jolla! I\'ve been Jonesing to eat here since Christmas 2015. Which is weird, because their page says they were established in 2017!!! Maybe a case of sushi by any other name?So, came down to San Diego to witness the ""Ultra eccentric super cult punk pop band Shonen Knife"" perform. Decided to stay at the ""just a couple minutes walk up (or down) the hill, so you can drink as much sake as you\'d prefer"" Sheraton La Jolla. And yes, my occasional Jonesing over trying out Musashi\'s did play a part in decision of staying at the Sheraton. So, in hindsight I was really setting myself up.Saturday: drove down to Safari Park, and then headed to La Jolla to check in, so my daughter could get in the pool. Meanwhile, wife napped. After napping and pooling, we headed down to Musashi. It\'s a small hole in the wall in a small strip mall. A Dominoes and two other small hole in the wall restaurants. 8 tables inside, and a few outside. No sushi bar. A white couple at one table and a white woman alone at another. I know, not a good sign!! It is La Jolla though! Still, it balanced out later after those three left, to be replaced by an Asian couple and an Asian woman alone. Then you take the three of us: white man (I prefer European-American), Asian woman and mixed daughter. STILL dead even in the white/Asian demographic. Apparently the waiter occasionally eats the food, and he\'s Asian.... so.... SCALES TIPPED! Sushi restaurant with mainly Asian diners!!! (Damn good thing that waiter doesn\'t always pack a lunch for work!)Speaking of service, was a young Asian dude, as I mentioned. He performed all tasks excellently. If I was a secret billionaire, you\'d be reading a news report about a waiter in a sushi restaurant in La Jolla receiving a $25,000 tip. But.... me poor, so no news report.Complimentary miso served quickly. Tea in a carafe already at your table. They do not offer a separate menu and pencil for nigiri orders. And nigiri comes one piece, not two. And the rolls are six pieces. All are quite inexpensive. As are the drinks. We got a chirashi bowl, like 8 nigiri selections (twins each), and two rolls. They had some new twists with salmon: smoked and seared. Interesting. Oh, and sake. They only serve hot sake, which isn\'t my preference, but not a big deal.Service was excellent, food.... not so much. The nigiri came out surprisingly quick, followed by the rolls and chirashi bowl. The rolls were exceptionally cold and a bit hard; as if they were pre-prepared. The nigiri was ok, but seemed most likely prepared beforehand to some degree. (Which is probably why waiter came back earlier to say they only had 2 octopus left.) Overall, I was a bit disappointed, but not actually surprised. Subconsciously I knew this place, by location alone, wasn\'t promising to be a diamond in the rough. And I\'m all Jonesed out, so it\'s all good. And usually when I stay overnight in San Diego, we stay in Old Town and do Mexican cuisine. So.... yeah.... it\'s all good. I wanted to give 4 stars to be generous, but sorry, I won\'t be back.', 'I\'ve got Japanese food cravings... and didn\'t know where to look. \xa0Google noted them as ""unassuming, mom-&-pop restaurant featuring a variety of sushi rolls & traditional Japanese plates"". \xa0Okay, I\'m down to try! \xa0I LOVE LOVE LOVE Mom & Pop type of restaurants!The first time I tried Musashi\'s was in May 2020 and several times after that in June and July 2020 (via UberEats).

I'm easily disappointed by sushi because it's so hard to find good quality places but this place is somehow so FRESH and so good. Their prices are low and very fair. Their sushi is definitely worth it. I ordered the lunch nigiri set plus mackerel nigiri and it was sooo good. I ordered delivery (via Uber eats which is doing 0$0.49 delivery or free delivery with orders over $30), but I'm planning on calling in and picking up next time to tip Musashi's themselves. Highly recommend!!"", 'This is my absolute favorite sushi place in San Diego! Prior to covid, my boyfriend and I would eat here at least once or twice a month. Everything that we have eaten here has been more than worth the price! Our server is extremely friendly and basically runs the show at musashis. Even if you do not live in La Jolla, it is definitely worth it! Not sure if they are doing dine in right now, but their takeout is just as good as dining in. My boyfriend always gets the chirashi bowl and we share a few of their other rolls. No other sushi restaurant in San Diego can compare! :)', 'Small little restaurant very good food great service and good prices.I recommend the Chirashi Bowl Special.', ""We placed a To Go Order on a Saturday evening and it was ready in about 15 minutes. The person taking our order was friendly and helpful. We ordered the Sukiyaki Beef Bowl, Seattle Roll, and California Roll. The portion sizes for all three items were generous. We were able to share all the items. And the prices were fair. So service and portion sizes deserve 5 stars. The beef bowl was average. The thinly sliced beef and sauce tasted good. However, when I ordered I asked if there was vegetables and was told there would be some zucchini. There were maybe 4 pieces of zucchini so that was disappointing. The sushi roll were filling since they were bigger than those at most other places. So that was good. The taste is a little on the bland side. Food gets a 3.5/5. That's why overall, we rate this place a 4/5. We would return here if we were hungry. The menu selection is good. Parking can be challenging since the lot is small but we didn't have any trouble when we went this time."", ""My family and I have been residents of the La Jolla/UTC area for almost a year and with sushi being my favorite food I set out to find my newest local spot. It was a trial by trial to find a restaurant that offered quality sushi for the right price and Musashi's achieves both! I'm so lucky to live so close to our newfound favorite spot that satisfies our (or my) latest sushi craving.Its exterior is unassuming - nestled between other small deli markets, a liquor store, and a stone's throw from a gas station within a small shopping center. However, once you make your way inside you'll find an intimate seating area and will be immediately greeted and seated. We've always felt welcomed and comfortable when dining in - another great plus to their atmosphere and overall dining experience. Around 5pm you'll quickly notice the surge of locals, students, and other families and the once quiet dining room is filled with a hum of table conversations. Thus, I highly recommend getting there near 5pm on any weeknight for this reason - otherwise you may find yourself waiting for a table.Having tried a variety of items from their simplistic menu, I have to say there's little no going wrong - no matter your preference of sushi (i.e. cooked, fresh, etc.). With an abundance of sushi restaurants in the area, each vying to entice customers by creating over-the-top plates - often drowning out the quality and taste of the fish itself, it's refreshing to find a place that respects their ingredients. I personally have enjoyed almost every piece of fresh nigiri that's offered and I love its freshness and quality. Their rolls are enjoyable as well - without the fuss of too many toppings. My husband loves their chirashi bowl and my preschooler their miso soup and a large helping of rice. It also doesn't take long to read other Yelpers review the affordability of the dining experience at Musashi's. Because of their no fuss approach to their menu, I've found they've been able to maintain affordable prices for their customers. This is a huge plus for us as well as the strong student body that calls this neighborhood home.Lastly, since Covid-19 caused businesses all over to close their doors, I've been supporting my own sushi addiction and Musashi's by ordering food to-go by giving them a call. With every order it's been on-time, correct, and packed with care. I highly suggest to order by phone and pick-up yourself as to ensure all orders are going 100% to their business and not to companies with high commission fees such as Grubhub. I also like (and highly encourage) to tip more than usual just to add an extra support to their staff during such a difficult time.So, whether you're dining-in (hopefully they'll be offering that soon!) or ordering takeout, I couldn't recommend Musashi's enough. They've been a welcoming place since we moved in and continues to help us through quarantine with a little fun to our weeknight dinner plans. Thank you to everyone there and can't wait to order again!"", ""Musashi's is one of my favorite places to dine in SD. My pictures are from pre-Covid times, but they're still doing take out during quarantine! Their delicious chirashi bowl is the thing to get. Its price point is amazing for the fact you can customize your chirashi bowl just how you like it; they'll replace any fish with your preferred fish choice (within what's offered in their standard chirashi bowl). Pretty consistent with their great fish quality, at its price.Service is always amazing. They're super kind and seem to have a great memory for the orders of regulars. Tea and miso soup is immediately offered when you sit down (at least before Covid). Extra spicy mayo available when asked.I've returned to support during the quarantine, and they've since stopped dine-in services. Pick-up orders only, and the makeshift service table is by the door. Quick phone call to place an order and my order was ready in the expected time they gave.""]"

I had a friend who told me that you had to come early if you wanted to snag any baked goods here. Fortunately, you can always order online the day before and come pick up your goods. I came before 10am on a Saturday and there were still some items up for grabs.

Not a particularly ""aesthetic"" bakery as many may seek out but your taste buds will validate your decision to come here better than any foodie social media post can! My boss recommended I try months prior and I have been coming back at least once every 2-3 weeks since. I usually rotate between the plain and almond croissants (solid choices for first visit) as well as the canele (interesting little french pastry with a doughy inside that reminded me of Vietnamese ""banh bo"" and crunchy, thick, carmelized crust). Monkey bread a lil too sweet for my taste. The owners are a South Korean couple that are so friendly and just exert good vibes you can feel from the moment you step in to the moment you (should) feel compelled to click on the gratifying tip options on the ipad before leaving. Their selection is a bit pricey for a casual snack so it\'s been an occassional treat for me. I wish they were open longer hours and every day of the week but i guess that\'s stopped me from coming more freq than I could afford haha. I\'ve also brought their pastries for family gatherings and work parties and its a sure hit. Was still flaky and yummi even after a 1.5 hr drive to OC.', ""All I can say is that this young lady can bake. Seriously, she makes some of the best scones I have had in a very long time. As you know, it's all about the texture, when it comes to a good scone, and this are on point with that semi dense nature and yet soft biscuit like texture. The scone was a cranberry one and not only were the cranberries flavorful but abundant as well.I also had another best of the best Morning Bun. I am a huge morning bun fan, and now that I have experienced them here, there will be only two places in San Diego where I will buy mine: Frost Me Cafe & Bakery on Little Italy and here at Canele Bakery. You know, I have had her almond scones and butter scones at earlier date when she sold her baked goods at the San Diego Food Market on Broadway, and I can certainly vouch for those too! Amazing.The bakery offers a small amount of seating outside."", 'The goods at this bakery are truly wonderful! I stopped by around 10:30am on a Wednesday and luckily there were still some caneles left as well as quite a few croissants. I ordered the plain croissant. The price was very reasonable, especially for the quality of pastry. The insides were buttery and flaky but moist, and outside of the croissant was thin and crispy and flaky. Every bite brought joy to my soul. I also tried a canele on a different occasion and while I have no grounds for comparison, I enjoyed it very much! The outer layer was thin and crunchy with a caramelized sugar taste that reminded me of a creme brulee. The inside of the canele was quite dense, moist, and spongy with a strong vanilla flavor.', ""What a gem of a spot! It's in a strip mall w a little store front - not where you would expect to find such exquisite pastries!There's a limited selection, but what's available is all made to perfection.I got a plain croissant and it had such a nice cross section and honey comb structure. It was perfectly light and airy.Would come back again. Wish they had some beverages to go w the pastries"", ""Super excited to see a bakery in UTC/La Jolla! I remember it use to be Lil Dipper, an ice cream place. Ordered online around 6am and went to pick it up at 9:30am when they opened.Monkey Bread - it was still warm! Super flakey and I could see the melted chocolate chips as I pulled it apart. It's crispy on the outside (especially the bottom since it was caramelized) and soft on the inside. I'm normally not a huge fan of chocolatey pastries but this one was good!Morning Bun - sadly a bit dry. It's super flakey and crispy with the sugar adding a crunch. Once I got to the center, there was a little bit of softness.Almond Croissant - disappointed that it was also dry because I love almond croissants! It's flakey and crispy but it wasn't as soft and buttery on the inside as I had hoped. The almond paste was good; I liked how it wasn't too sweet.Canelé - my favorite! The crunchy caramelized crust complimented the soft custard center. It almost felt like I was eating creme brûlée in pastry form. If only I could taste this right out of the oven! So glad I ordered 2 but wish I thought to warm it up!Overall, I thought the monkey bread and canelé stood out to me! Sadly, the morning bun and almond croissant were on the dry side. Considering the glowing reviews, it might have been the batch I got that was dry."", ""My friend told me about this bakery, so I had to check them out. I ordered a few caneles, almond croissants, chocolate croissants, monkey bread, and morning buns. When I came to pick them up, it was already neatly packaged. I was disappointed that I couldn't order any almond chocolate croissants online though. It was either one or the other, but it was available in store. I mentioned this to them, so I think they were able to fix this glitch. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Caneles are hard to find and this one hit the spot. I liked that the monkey bread had chocolate inside of them. The chocolate croissants could've used more chocolate though. My least favorite was the morning buns. I loved the almond croissaints so much! They were huge, flaky, buttery, and not greasy at all."", ""I was told that I would find the best croissants here. To be frank, I disagree with that statement. The pastries are good but they're not like AMAZING.My mom and I came here on a Saturday morning last week. Canele's is located across the street from the UCSD grad student housing (and is next to RubiCon deli for those who are familiar with the area and it has taken the store front of Lil Dipper). There was no line when we went which was nice. And we actually arrived just as soon as the almond croissants had been taken out of the oven so they were nice and warm. The lady working the cash register was super nice and answered our questions about what a Canele pastry was, and its sort of like a custard. My mom and I ended up getting 2 almond croissants, monkey bread, and a morning bun. The morning bun, we did not like this at all. It legit tastes like cinnamon toast crunch cereal and tbh I don't like cinnamon toast crunch, it's meh. But if you like cinnamon toast crunch then that pastry is for you.The monkey bread had chocolate inside of it which was unexpected. We had never had monkey bread with chocolate inside of it before. I liked the chocolate inside of it but my mom wasn't a fan at all.The almond croissants have a lot of almonds on them and are flaky but idk, it feels like something was missing. They were nice and warm tho when we ate them which was nice considering it was a cold rainy day when we went.Overall the desserts are good but if I compare it to other bakeries, I wouldn't want these pastries. These are good pastries if you haven't hit up the other ones in SD.Prices are a lot more reasonable tho here. And the interior of the place is super clean and minimalistic. Also good customer service. But will I be back? Prob not because it didn't really satisfy my almond croissant/pastry cravings."", ""2021/04/22 9:00A hidden-gem bakery with a small and perfected selection of croissants and sweets.I pre-ordered an Almond Chocolate Croissant, Ham Cheese Croissant, and Canele for pick-up through their website.Here are the highlights:- When I walked in to pick up my order, I was immediately hit by a heavenly smell of buttery pastry.- Their croissants are crazy flaky with thin and crispy layers. The inside was light and airy.- Each croissant is pretty big and definitely could be shared between 2 people.- The Ham Cheese Croissant was great. The cheese spilled out a bit during baking and turned crispy. There wasn't a lot of ham; the focus is on the croissant's buttery flavour.- \xa0Can't decide between almond or chocolate? The Almond Chocolate Croissant has (still melty) chocolate on the inside and almond cream and toasted almond slivers on top. I would say there's actually a little too much almond filling on top, since it's so rich and sweet. - This is my first time having a canelé. It's got a hard exterior with a sticky and soft interior. The flavour is very caramelized--a slight bitterness intermixed in the sweetness."", ""The best croissants that you'll probably find in san diego. Super unassuming location and storefront but they churn out some delicious baked goods! We came on a Saturday but ordered online the night before which I recommend because by the time we got there 30 minutes after opening the bakery case was almost empty and they had a ton of online pick up orders.We got the almond croissant and the almond chocolate croissant. The only difference being that the chocolate one had a chocolate filling and the normal almond one doesn't have a filling. They were super generous with the almond topping for each one and it wasn't overly sweet. I do like when almond croissants have an almond paste filling normally but I really didn't miss it here since they had so much on top. They both had perfectly flaky, buttery layers and the first bite I took I knew this was gonna be a great croissant. Would definitely come back to try their other baked goods!""]"

I decided to go with their VG Classic (vegan burger) and sweet potato fries. Before I tell you about the burger, I'll start by saying it came to me with a \xa0regular bun not gluten free. For me personally, I'm not bothered by a mess up, how the restaurant handles it is what means more to me. Once I let someone know, she immediately apologized, put a rush on my re-order and I had it in less than 10 minutes. Quite honestly, the burger could have been average but because of that customer service, I would have still given a great review. Well done Veggie Grill.

It doesn't blow you away with its food, but I love that there's such a successful vegan chain doing this style of food."", ""Pre-pandemic:I've been a fan of Veggie Grill for years (first time trying their food was on Sunset in Hollywood). Glad they've since expanded to SD. Since it's located within UTC, parking is throughout the mall. A couple favorites are the Santa Fe & Buffalo 'Chicken' sandwiches, as well as the Reuben. Either regular fries or Sweetheart Fries (sweet potato) are suitable side options.

At this point all the other restaurants around were closed. Luckily we got spoons from the ice cream store even though both of us got a salad -_-The Mac and cheese was an absolute WASTE of time/money/calories. I am not sure where the cheese was and it tasted like it was just olive oil and garlic? Vegan Mac and cheese is not difficult to make. Also, as it was my friends FIRST time trying vegan food it would have been nice for her to try a good version.. The cauliflower bites were good and I did like the Caesar salad. Altogether I think I would be willing to give it another shot but I would not get my hopes up about the Mac and cheese.', 'YUMMY! 1st time at this location, it was located inside a shopping mall (outdoor shopping mall) lol so from the entrance to the parking make a right and try to find parking around there, or outside of the parking structure for easier access.

The food also took a long time for a fast food restaurant, around 20 minutes. The food was pretty good but not particularly remarkable. The White Bean Chili tasted like any other chili. The Sesame Crusted Chickin' was good, with a texture that's something between real chicken and tofu (spongy in a way). The wild rice patty in the House Veggie Burger had a good flavour and crispy bits of rice in it. The Crispy Fries are thick-cut, and they were good except one cut the roof of my mouth. I'm not sure if that's because I have sensitive gums or if the fries were cut hazardously.""]"

I recently went on a long weekend trip to SD with some friends. We found Poke Subarashi on Yelp while we were exploring La Jolla and decided to stop by for some dinner. Upon entering, the store was completely empty - sans the lady working there. I ordered a regular bowl (2 topping on a bed of brown rice). The first flag was that my rice was clumped together and hard. It seems like we got the end of the pot, so we all had dry/hard/old rice. The second flag was that the scoops of fish were really really tiny. I got scallops and salmon and my bowl was honestly just all rice. The protein and veggies available just weren't that fresh (not to mention the rice). The lady working there was stingy with portion sizes, but extra generous with sauce and edamame?

Rather, they kept them in those huge industrial sized blue plastic bins! .... That was really weird2. CON - The protein/vegetable wasn't super fresh. Honestly, this didn't bother me that much, but it really bothered my wife. But I understand her point, the fish wasn't that good.3. CON - They give you very little toppings. I'm not talking about the variety of toppings, I'm talking about the actual amount they give you was pretty little.4. PRO/CON - They give you a lot of sauce. I guess some people like that, but for us, it just seemed really salty. I guess by adding a lot of sauce, it hides the mediocre quality fish/vegetable. Also, they don't mix the fish/vegetable with the sauce, but rather, they drizzle it on top.5. CON - No masago!! I've never been to a poke place where they didn't have masago (those little orange fish eggs). That was very surprising.6. PRO - First scoop of avocado is free. Credit where credit is due, this was a pretty nice surprise.Overall, I was really confused how this place got 4.5 stars. We were really let down by this place and it honestly makes me wonder if most of these reviews are fake."", ""Decent poke spot but not as good compared to other places I've been. The main reason is a) portions & b) the way it looks. The portions were smaller than I've had every other place & for the same price. They had a few toppings but not many.

Next we got a little salad with fresh cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese, and a great dressing. I was thoroughly enjoying my experience and then the Greek Town burger arrived. It is made with lamb and feta. It's hands down one of the best burgers I have eaten. It was served with seasoned shoestring fries. So good. My dad also got the rack of lamb and mom got a gyros.

The only drawback to this place is that it is pretty pricey for a sandwich. You are going to end up paying 13-15 bucks for a sandwich and a drink.

You can tell their fish is fresh from the first bite. Even when I lived in Hawaii, sometimes their poke was frozen and you knew it was a couple days old.

In all their pokes, HFS really let's the quality of their seafood speak for itself. And no wonder -- the fish is the BEST I've had probably anywhere in California. They don't overcomplicate things the way other poke places do, meaning you won't find a Chipotle-style assembly line of toppings to choose from here... and the food is all the more delicious for it! I always gravitate towards the garlic salmon poke and wasabi salmon poke (neither of which have soy, sauce, which I ~believe~ makes them gluten free, for my GF lovelies out there), and my friends often opt for the spicy ahi or the shoyu ahi! They have a rotating menu of poke, and offer plenty of non-poke options like fish tacos! They also offer several traditional Hawaiian snacks like spam musubi, macadamia cookies, etc. They even sell some goodies that are otherwise hard for me to find, like Portuguese sausage, and pro-tip: they sell leftover poke for a discounted price, which I honestly think is equally (if not more!) delicious! \xa0Anyway, I could go on and on, but if you're in the mood for poke, this place is a MUST-try.

The line moved quickly but not as quickly as I would have liked since my husband and son were waiting in the car and my newborn son was hungry!As soon as I got to the counter I decided to get the plate. 3 choices of poke and 2 scoops of white or brown rice or Mac salad. There was a freezer in the room and decided to check it out. There was sashimi and Mac salad available so I decided to buy some for dinner. I ordered the garlic salmon, spicy salmon, and bluefin ahi ($3 extra). Everything I ordered was so fresh and delicious!!! I couldn't believe how fresh the fish was and just melted in my mouth.

There is a good variety of poke and it is just like Hawaiian style poke, not what is usually available at a poke shop in the states.

Not a bad thing, but it might not appeal to some people if you enjoy having spicy mayo drenched on your bowl (like me) We got the garlic salmon & sesame albacore and you can choose to have it over salad or with rice!

It didn't disappoint! It's located in an industrial area at the end of the street. Plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy your meal.The type of fish will probably vary daily.

Definitely more than enough for 2 ppl to share!The fish was so fresh!!! Melt in your mouth fresh. My favorite would have to be the garlic salmon and Pearl Harbor ahi.

This place isn\'t bad if you\'re craving quick food, and it\'s probably one of the better food choices in terms of healthiness in the UTC food court.

Service is quick and staff is wearing masks!"", ""Bibigo used to occupy this stall at the dining terrace (aka food court) of the UTC Mall. Rice Goban recently took over with a similar concept of boxes and bowls minus the hot stones. Kids' meals, sides, and drinks rounded out the rest of the menu offerings. The food is assembled in a Chipotle-style manner after you place an order at the register.The former were called Hansang Boxes ($10.99) in which you build your own. The first step was picking a protein (Korean beef bulgogi, honey fried chicken, galbi chicken, or crispy tofu), next was choosing a base (white rice, bulgogi fried rice, bulgogi noodle, or salad), and last was finishing with a side (bulgogi poutine fries, Korean fried chicken, fried dumplings, banchan platter, or kimchi). A small side salad came with the box. Adding a fried egg cost another $1.50 and choosing the bulgogi or fried chicken as a protein was an additional $1. The latter were called Bibimbap Bowls ($9.99) which were preset combinations served with broccoli, bean sprouts, pickled red cabbage, carrots, and white rice. Five different varieties (bulgogi, Korean fried chicken, honey fried chicken, galbi chicken, or crispy tofu) were available. The same respective extra charges of $1 and $1.50 applied if you chose the above add-ons.My selection was a Hansang Box with Korean beef bulgogi, bulgogi noodles, and honey garlic Korean fried chicken. When I saw bulgogi noodles, I assumed it would be of the jap chae variety (i.e. stir-fried glass noodles). To my disappointment, the noodles were made of wheat flour like those you would find in yakisoba. The portion size of the components was okay. I wasn't thrilled with the surcharges even though I did pick the Korean beef bulgogi as a protein. The meat could have used a stronger marinade. I awarded three stars for quality, quantity, and pricing, the last of which was rather high for fast-casual Korean fare."", 'Amazing food oh my goodness! I ordered the Hansang Boxes with honey KFC fried chicken, white rice and honey fried chicken. It came with a side salad. The honey KFC fried chicken was crunchy to the right amount, the honey chicken was soft and sweet.1000/10 coming back for sure.']"

I walked down the street and came back about 20 mins later? and food was ready! woo. \xa0Popped it open. So disclaimer. I'd been eating all day and I wasn't very hungry... what a shame. The chicken sunrise was SO GOOD. I couldn't tell if they already put syrup on it cause it felt a little wet but maybe just from the steam? The waffle was so soft... everything blended so well together. Sweet, savory deliciousness.... The most memorable flavor was that I think they had rosemary in the batter and it's fried onto the chicken... Or some type of herb. It was so good. \xa0Pretty hard to share with 3 people though... we all just wanted a little taste. \xa0The poppers howerever, I wasn't a big fan of. Maybe I was just impatient. Keep in mind, this is San Diego, every single person had their masks off (pretty sure staff was masked up though)... tables were really close together... Heck, there was this lady with her mask on and her daughter was saying she looked like a crazy person. f that man. don't mask shame. if anything y'all are the dummies. So of course I had to shout out that she wasn't crazy. I got your back lady. \xa0ANYWAYS. so all this being said. Poppers really aren't easy to eat. trying to stay away from everyone (had set the poppers on the table and I was stepping away to take my mask off and eat.) So just. really annoying. you're using plastic forks that don't really stab into the hard deep fried balls very well... and using your hands gets messy and the balls are hotter than the surface of the sun. plus a little dry... guess I shoulda opened up the syrup but didn't want to have it open when we inevitably had leftovers :\\ idk. ANYWAYS THE BALLS. It was basically just deep fried batter with chicken inside. a little dry. not that much of a wow factor. Both my dining partners said they preferred the balls though... hmmm sus. \xa0Just had one to try since I was still so full and I just let one of the bois take it home for later.I hope that these guys make it. They're so busy and I hope it doesn't die down. But I also hope that don't get lazy and stop trying. Hopefully they can optimize their restaurant and people keep coming.

I guess... worth mentioning in the review but don't take stars off for it or anythin.) ANYWAYS. It was def worth the visit. Would I make the drive down SPECIFICALLY to have chicken and waffles?

Cute and small, packed with many flavors to satisfy any palate. The staff are really cool too. They're so down to earth. They came outside to chat a bit. Told us a little back story to how they came about. Super humble people. That's why I love supporting small local businesses. My only thing is they close early, so I wouldn't suggest going no more than 15minutes prior to closing hours. And if you're waiting in line, it's worth the wait. Order the Chicken Sunrise, a cool spin on chicken and waffles. I'm a sucker for eggs on a burger, so I immediately went for that.

Along with their famed buns, we also ordered:Shanghai Pan-Fried RicecakeCrispy Fish Fillet with SeaweedCrispy Spicy Stinky Tofu with PorkIn the past I've also ordered their XLB, their Zha Jiang Mein, various different dishes, and all were very good (which is why I continue to come here!), but since this particular takeout order was the freshest in my mind, I will just review the above dishes.The Shanghai Pan-Fried Ricecake was delicious, and had that nice wok-hei taste that Chinese restaurants all have - was nice and chewy, despite microwaving it a bit when I took it home. Exactly as expected.The Crispy Fish Fillet I wouldn't order again mainly because the seaweed was very subtle. As a normal fish fillet it's great, but if you're looking for specifically a seaweed flavor I couldn't really detect it, but perhaps it's because I'm used to pretty strong seaweed flavors.And now to the dish I ordered - I'm a stinky tofu fan. I like my stinky tofu Taiwanese style, and the only place I am aware of that served it here in San Diego closed down :(. However, I will not complain if any Chinese restaurant chooses to serve this dish because the crispiness of stinky tofu is to die for. Beats any normal fried tofu. And it's always usually served a little spicy. I could just eat this like a snack day in day out... (though my body wouldn't like it much). This stinky tofu was perfect Chinese style. (Taiwanese style stinky tofu is served with a brown sweet sauce, and pickled cabbage).And of course, the Shanghai Sesame Grilled Buns were exactly as expected and made my mom pretty happy. She commented yet again about how tasty they were while she ate them and we saved the rest of them for her.I'll be back obviously. Hard to find anything really bad on their menu. It is an incredibly long menu with lots of great choices (mainly Shanghai-nese food), the service is fairly fast and speedy like most Chinese restaurants. I highly recommend this restaurant if you like Northern type Chinese restaurants (like noodle heavy, bun and dumpling heavy cuisine). You won't be disappointed.The worst thing about this restaurant is that it's located at the Convoy parking lot from hell. Everyone knows which parking lot that is. I always just park far away from the plaza and walk. It would be difficult for people who are unable to walk as the parking lot is well... hell and it can be a very long wait to find a parking space. I've walked two and a half long blocks away to get to the restaurants in this plaza (and next door). Plan your eating adventures well to avoid having to deal with peak hour. All in all, I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back."", ""Not only is their food delicious, but service is always amazing and the staff and menu not only recognize vegetarian dishes, but even vegan!

The eels were stir-fried with shiitake mushrooms and then drenched with hot oil. They had a chewy and bouncy texture.- This place's Crispy Spicy Stinky Tofu w/ Pork is probably the closest that you're going to get to Chinese street-food stinky tofu in San Diego.

Or maybe it was just an off night but it seemed like I ordered mostly the latter which was a bummer. I was referred here by multiple friends who had glowing reviews, one even saying the dumplings were better than din tai. I will have to politely disagree.

They were amazing!Everything else (shrimp Creole sandwich, etouffee) was expensive and tasteless. I just took a couple of bites and threw it out. It was so bland - just tomatoes and bell peppers. Generous amounts of shrimp but bland. This restaurant was an expensive $60 mistake (for two people).Good thing we had two orders of beignets - they were hot and amazing! Wish someone had warned us beforehand to avoid the food though. Also, the service was good - the teen kid cashiering was super nice!', ""Definitely a hidden gem. I was in the Sorrento valley area for an appointment and decided to look up food in the area for a late lunch. Found this place hidden on Miramar.My eyes were attracted to the beignets. Haven't had one in a while. The gumbo is definitely one of my favorite dishes. Wish I had gotten a larger order. Probably one of the best I've had in the area.I also got their chicken strips and cajun fries since I was hungry and needed something I can eat in the car right away. I don't know what they put in their chicken, but it was just the perfect combination of crunchy outside and soft and juicy on the inside (a hard feat to achieve for fried chicken!)Too bad it's a little way out of the way for me, but will definitely drop by here again if I'm in the area."", ']We were curious to see what this spot offered after someone had recommended this restaurant - it\'s not easily seen on the long straightaway of Miramar, but there\'s a small parking lot available for all the businesses nearby. \xa0LouZiana offers your classic traditional foods like Gumbo, Jambalaya and Red Beans + Rice, but also has other fan favorites such as Po-Boys and Fried Seafood plates. There\'s options for large Family Meals if you have a bigger group to feed!Fried Catfish Po-Boy (Regular, Creole Style: $15.25): Fairly pricey as their Regular size is only 7"", and changing it to Creole Style also tacks on an additional ~$2. It could have been because we didn\'t eat it fresh, but the French Bread was soggy from the sauce, and everything inside was a bit mushy. I was able to try one of our other friend\'s Po-Boy that was Traditional Style, and thought the Creole sauce wasn\'t that big of a difference for the extra charge.Cup of Jambalaya ($8.25): Again, pricey for the size of the cup they give you. Nothing too special about their Jambalaya, just what you\'d expect from any regular spot. Pop\'s Bread Pudding w/ Whiskey Butter Sauce ($7.25): We did eat this last because it was dessert, but the Bread Pudding looked like it could\'ve been crispier when fresh. The flavors were delicious though.Overall, the portion sizes and my personal tastes don\'t really amount to the prices. It was nice to give it a try once, but I probably won\'t come back again.', ""I'm from South Louisiana and am very picky about cajun food. I can absolutely say this place is 100% legit! I had the shrimp poboy dressed and it was fantastic.

Strongly recommend the no1 platter for 2 people: pulled pork, pork ribs, brisket, and chicken with two sides of fried okra and onion ring plus corn bread. Best brisket ever, not too dry with great bbq sauce on the side. The meat had an excellent smoky charred flavor.

Everyone is so nice and friendly here.That's the only reason I'm posting a yelp review while still in the restaurant even after walking a whole day in the safari park."", ""I ordered the sampler platter from Doordash after reading an article from the San Diego Eater for the best bbq in SD. I was surprised since I had never heard of this place (probably due to its location on Miramar). I've found my new favorite bbq place in San Diego. All of the meat was juicy and just the right amount of smoke. I appreciate the meat not being slathered in BBQ sauce since I couldn't try it with or without. Kudos to the chicken breast with the small wing attached. Very tasty. Breast was also juicy, an easy cut to dry out.My favorite type of bbq is pulled pork. They hit it out of the park. Great crust, tender and juicy. Can't wait to eat again."", ""My bf and I enjoyed sampler plate No.1 with chicken, pork ribs, pulled pork, brisket, fries, mac salad, and cornbread. \xa0We also ordered an extra potato salad side.First: the cornbread is some of the best cornbread I've ever had. Leave a bite for the end of the meal! I mistakenly ate it at the start of the meal only to crave a bit of sweetness to finish.The sampler platter was perfect for two. We left very satisfied with some leftover cold sides. Pro tip: the mac salad is great for breakfast. We requested our bbq sauce on our proteins but ended up requesting an extra side for dipping. With sauce that good, you'll want extra.The pork ribs were perfectly cooked, moist, the meat still attached to the bone but easily pulls off when you take a bite. That's how a rib should be. The pulled pork and brisket were both 10s! The chicken we saved for last and after the meat we just enjoyed, we weren't excited BUT that chicken was so bomb! Juicy! Flavorful! A gorgeous quarter chick!Both the mac and potato salad were delicious but they had very similar flavor profiles so you don't need both in one sitting. I'm excited to mix it up next time and try the coleslaw or beans. The fries were hot, somewhere between steak and traditional cut fry, with great seasoning.Everyone sitting around us ordered sandwiches and they looked amazing! We agreed we would try a sandwich next time. My only real complaint, and this is not to discourage anyone from eating at Abbey's but... the napkins are not robust enough for the bbq eating you will experience here. They are too thin and delicate for the sauce drippin' meats that require both hands if you're doing it right. BYOT: Bring Your Own Towelette!"", ""I remember trying the barbecue at the Kearny Mesa branch of Abbey's before they had closed, and the operations consolidated to this location which is in the middle of a Miramar strip mall. I arrived right as the doors swung open for the beginning of the lunch hour so parking spaces were ample, and the dining room was empty.It's all about the meats which meant my strategy was to purchase a few cuts a la carte and pass on the sides. My choices were a 1/2 lb serving each of brisket, hot links, and turkey with the BBQ sauce on the side. It turned out that the sauce was tangy and spicy so I am glad I didn't ask the kitchen to smear it on the servings.The brisket and turkey were okay, but they were on the drier side. The meats didn't come out of the smoker as moist as they do in Texas which is the holy grail. The sausage had enough kick that no sauce was needed to dip the slices. The menu prices were competitive even with the increase in wholesale costs resulting from the pandemic disruption to the supply chain."", ""Hi Yelpers. \xa0 I just want to give a quick update about Abby's BBQ located on Miramar Road. \xa0I was contacted by the owner Mark and he was very apologetic about my last visit. \xa0He assured me that customer service is usually great , and that day it was unfortunately not. \xa0Mr. Mark invited me back to Abby's to try some more pulled pork and brisket. I was happy to accept the offer. \xa0Yelpers if you have not tried their pulled pork and brisket, you're missing out. \xa0Trust me it's worth the drive and the money. \xa0I took pictures of the two to show you how delicious it looks. \xa0Mmmmm yummy. \xa0I want to thank Mark the owner and Abby's BBQ for a great experience today. \xa0If you decide to go, make sure to say hello to Mark. \xa0He's a great guy and owner."", 'The Family friendly atmosphere is very nice here. We were welcomed by the staff as it was our first time. They recommended the number one sampler as a starter. We got that plus burnt ends. Bbq sauces were a tangy one and spicy one (both great and not overwhelming). The owner gave us a quick tour at the end of smoker and the kinds of wood used. Food took some time to make, but there were many orders ahead of us and they really put in the love for each order. (leave no stone unturned mentality) Ways to elevate the game: offer some pickles with certain plates to help clean the palate. Add maybe two more TVs or increase the size of the one center TV.Very awesome first visit and we will back to try more food in the future', ""I didn't think it was possible for this establishment to get any better but it has! I recently dropped by for dinner and MANNN has this place upgraded! The restaurant has a new vibe with more of BBQ atmosphere and I dig it! It's more circled around the food and what the restaurant is all about. The new menu on the wall is great and so clear and easier on the eyes, the new wall decor is so modern and fun, and let's not forget about the new outdoor sign!  Also, there's quite a few new beers on tap - IPAs too :) The food plating has upgraded!! I truly enjoy the new platter serving style more than the traditional basket and I SWEAR the serving portions are BIGGER. Not to mention their CORN BREAD- so good you need more than one.I love this restaurant and it's so exciting to see them grow and manifest the BBQ dream! Keep doing it big Abbey's Real Texas BBQ!Also If you haven't bought their signature bucket hat you're missing out!"", 'A friend brought the family pack with tri-tip to a potluck. We had to warm up the food, but it was still so delicious! I had to take my son, because he is a huge bbq fan. We actually went to the restaurant the next day, but I have to sadly say it was a bit disappointing. The tri-tip was 2/5. The pieces did not taste good and we ate right in the restaurant. It feels like it was from a completely different place. We both were so bummed! However, the cornbread is 5/5. It was the same both days. It is like dessert: sweet and tasty. The potato salad is decent as well as the rice and beans. Both 3.5/5. We will have to go back another time. I hope we do get some better pieces of meat. I will update my review after that visit.']"

The bread is a hunk of a loaf that is cut only partially though. Therefore the ""insides"" of my sandwich were actually more sitting on top of the bread on a bed of lettuce. Having the bread this way means there is way more bread that I needed in a sandwich, less filling than I would have expected, and also the sandwich is much taller than I would have thought, which makes it not the most easy to eat thing in the world. Shrimp chips were good especially since some of them had additional spices on top.

There's a good amount so you shouldn't have any trouble.I was driving down on the 15 fwy when I called in my order. The woman who took my order was very friendly and cheerful. Got the Leviathan for my girl and the Chimera for myself. I almost got the Neptune but will save that for next time. The Aswang looks bomb af too. Pretty much in my radar to try it all, eventually! That Leviathan is the epitome of a lobster sandwich!! It was definitely a bit bigger than Wicked Maine Lobster's version, and it also came with thick fries. The chunks of lobster do it no justice. You have to put it in your mouth to knowwwww, ya know?! My Chimera...I thought long and hard about it because I love scallops and bacon and that's what's in the Neptune. Today, however, kbbq and shrimp won me over. YES. You read that correctly: KBBQ AND SHRIMP, together in a grilled cheese sandwich!! Who even knew this was a thing?! I do, now! Every morsel was so tender and flavorful. I surely did take the time to savor each bite. A sandwich like this deserves that much!When I pulled into the parking lot, I was able to park right in front of the doors.

Plenty of food either way for 2 people to share.', ""Bussed here from around the UTC area with my friend because she really wanted to try out this award winning place before she went home after graduation and would never come back to SD. Arrived at around 2:50PM (10 mins before closing) and ordered a Siren sandwich (by recommendation of the cashier) and a chowder. I really enjoyed the chowder! Lots of content and tasted great. But the sandwich, I felt like there was a little too much bread, and maybe it was a little overpriced for what it was offering. I think this place prides itself on its quality over quantity.Atmosphere/Presentation: as you can see from the picture it looks super pretty! We went right when covid protocols were starting to lift a little bit they still wrapped everything up in in little plastic containers and all in a nicely tied plastic bag. Really good packaging and I think a really nice place to sit too! 5/5Service: I have no complaints about the service, they were fast and kind and incredibly covid conscious. 5/5Taste: this is where it gets a little interesting. To get the really nice presentation where all of the sandwich interior looks like it's bursting out, they actually cut a very large slice of bread only around halfway through so that the interior sits on top of it. So it feels like I'm eating a lot more bread than I intended, and I'm getting less than what I imagined in my mind when I purchased it, especially since the sandwich is not exactly cheap. The sandwich itself tasted fine, I don't think it was mind-blowing or something I remember super fondly and salivate over. The chowder however I really liked, lots of seafood inside of it and really enjoyed dipping my excess bread in it to eat! 3/5Overall, I think this is a pretty solid place if you care about aesthetics. Everything looks very pretty and it would great on an Instagram story! However, if you care more about getting value for your money in taste and quantity please lower your expectations a little.

I pre-ordered a londras sheet sponge cake for Mother's Day, which was 1/4 sheet (still a lot!!!) and ube and mocha flavored with Bavarian cream in the middle. The cake was so tasty, soft, and very addicting that it was gone the very next day from family eating it! Btw, You can totally customize the sheet sponge cake online with different creams/fillings and cake flavors! Some of their flavors are ube, pandan, vanilla, mocha, and passion fruit to name a few. Keep in mind that preordering a sheet sponge cake takes a minimum of 24 hours prior to pickup date and time. You can also specify if you want the cake picked up ASAP next day or a later time. I'm addition to cake, the bakery also has a variety of pastries, a la carte items like empanadas, and sandwiches!"", ""Support local! My mom wanted an ube macapuno cake for her birthday and I found this place on Yelp. Ordering a cake was easy with their online ordering, and the staff was super nice when they called about pushing back my pick up time for the cake (which was fine because couldn't pick it up until later anyways). The cake was perfectly spongey and flavored well, not too sweet at all. Unfortunately, my lower rating goes to the filling that was lacking.. the flavor was amazing but the proportion of coconut filling to cake was not very good. I feel like there were just a couple of pieces of coconut per slice. The price was also high for a 1/4 sheet size cake. I would still go back to try some of their other offerings, but probably no more cakes from there."", ""One of my favorite places for their Pandan Londres cake with coconut (makapuno) cream in middle \xa0long since before new ownership took over about 2-3 years ago. Sad to say, quality of the cake slowly shifted especially this last batch i bought during the CNY/Valentines Day Holiday weekend. They use to be more spongy, dry outside and natural pandan flavor and colors. Last few orders had too much moisture where the cake would start to break and separate and stuck to the parchment paper underneath. Pretty much lack of spongy/bounce texture like it use to.Why now the 2 stars, seriously tough times we are going through right now, i really avoid rating on places thats loses its ratings but this one I just couldn't. If you see my pictures attached, you will understand why. Texture getting worse is bad enough, but decreasing pandan into your cakes and covering up the then lack of pandan color and flavors with massive green food coloring?! Plus a cake that then toppled off and falling apart?! Now that's going a bit overboard.We understand it's tough times and if you need to raise thr cost, it will be understandable and putting some TLC and pride into your food, i am sure many are willing to pay for as there wasn't any places like your cakes. But please don't decrease your quality and feel it is ok for the kids to ingest so much artificial food coloring. Unfortunately, after this last order, my family and friends won't be coming back to order them anymore unless they fix this and bring back the recipe my family once enjoyed."", 'Husband stopped in this morning, and learned the bakery is under new ownership. The interior is brighter, definitely noticeable from the outside. He picked up fresh pandesal, a grilled cheese sandwich with spam, and some malasadas!!They still have the Londres cake everyone buys, but it seems like there is more. \xa0We expect to be coming by more often to fulfill our pandesal cravings. \xa0I liked the custard and ube malasadas. Maybe even pick up some ube butter.', ""I remember my childhood years my parents would buy Londres desserts to bring to parties or for our own celebrations. I don't think anyone else in town can make delicious Londres sponge cakes like Andell's. My favorite is the Ube Londres with Bavarian cream filling."", ""I got my nails done this morning at the nail salon next door and decided to try the banh mi sandwiches here for the first time. I ordered the bulgogi and grilled chicken to go and it took an unbelievable 30 minutes! When I got my order, they made my banh mi wrong (UGH!) and after another 15 minutes, I asked the cashier if my sandwich was ready. I asked for a refund instead and the cashier said she would check if they were making my sandwich and if not, she would issue a refund. They should have my fixed my order immediately! I politely said no and told her I wanted a refund because I couldn't wait any longer. The cashiers were very nice and apologized for the long wait and issued my refund. I really don't understand why it took so long to make banh mis. K sandwiches in Linda Vista is so much busier and they are always very quick! \xa0I noticed everyone mostly was picking up online orders and maybe they took a priority over my order. But 30 minutes for two sandwiches is just ridiculous! My mani/pedi took less time!! My husband's banh mi was cold due to the long wait and he rated it a 6/10. Needless to say, we won't be returning. FYI, if you still decide to try a banh mi here, don't add a fried egg because it's not a fried egg, it's just one big scrambled egg! End scene."", 'Came here after seeing the amazing reviews, especially about their cake, but unfortunately we left disappointed.First off, we tried coming here once in the afternoon and there was a line out the door. Upon peering inside, there was no one at the front register! We waited at least 5 minutes to realize that this line was going no where and we had to leave.We came back during the morning and the same thing - we entered and there was no one at the front register. You could obviously hear the staff talking VERY loudly to each other in the back. There was no bell or anything to notify that there are customers waiting in the front.Finally, a lady came out and said she would be right with us. She was so distracted! She kept talking very loudly to a coworker the entire time we were there. Finally she turned to us and said ""what can I get for you?"" I replied with ""this is our first time here!"" in hopes to get some guidance and recommendations. However, when I was telling her this, she completely talked over me to her coworker, totally distracted. She said ""sorry, what?"" and I just dropped it. AWFUL customer service. I\'ve never experienced this before.I ended up getting a pandan swiss roll and an ube swiss roll. There is SO much cream in them, and honestly they didn\'t blow me away. With the disappointing cakes and awful customer service, I don\'t think I\'d return and I wouldn\'t recommend this place. Such a disappointment.', ""SHHH! \xa0Should I tell you that they sell malasadas here? \xa0I almost don't want to share this with you...They are the best and closest to the islands that one can get here on the mainland...Order ahead of time. I promise you will not be disappointed! \xa0Their cakes are also very good. \xa0Each time I have ordered the cashier is so welcoming and friendly."", 'I used to come here many years ago for their specialty Londres cake. With the new ownership they have added more items on their menu. Finally got a chance to check it out. Their pandesal sandwiches are delicious. We had the Spam, Egg & Cheese and also the Corned Beef Potato egg hash sandwich. Yummy! Their Banh mi sandwich I was not too crazy about. I felt the bun was a bit on the hard and thick side for me. I tried their vegetable eggroll today too and it was made just right: crispy and good. Ask for the vinegar garlic dipping sauce. Goes well with it. They still sell the Londres cake and also they have party tray catering foods as well now.They also have a variety of Filipino desserts, \xa0snack and grocery items for sale. I am looking forward to coming back to try their empanadas and Turon.', ""After getting my teeth nice and clean from the dentist this morning, I realized that there was a Filipino bakery eatery right in the same plaza. So in I go and out I came with these treats. Couldn't eat for 30 minutes after my cleaning and the smell of the lumpia definitely tested my patience. The malasadas (pineapple cream, custard, ube paste) were delicious! Had to sample a little of each. The ube and pandas sponge cakes were moist and had the perfect amount of sweetness. Ube tres le ches was probably my least favorite but still good. I love Ube! Next time will have to try their ube milk boba drink.""]"

I would've liked this roll better without the imitation crab.- With the sliced mushrooms and truffle oil, the Miso Butter Mac 'N Cheese was very similar to a typical truffle macaroni and cheese you'd find at other places. The corn was a nice addition. On the other hand, I couldn't discern any miso flavour. It tasted great after microwaving it so that it's piping hot and the cheese was nice and melted.

It was so sweet.', ""This spot has improved under new ownership and leadership of Tony and Kim and their team. \xa0The menu has been updated and everything we've had in 2021 is amazing. \xa0Highly recommend the Tong Crew Ramen which offers a little more spice and pork portions than the original Tonkatsu Ramen (also great). \xa0Tong is five star quality with a cozy feel."", ""Overall the appetizers were exceptional. Here's what we got:Garlic edamame: bursting with flavor, I highly recommend this dish. I love garlic and this dish hit the spot, perfect balance of saucy garlic bits sprinkled on topTakoyaki: tender and gooey, with a crisp exterior. Nice chunks of octopus insideFried tofu: perfectly fried, extra crispy skin compliments the contrasting soft tofu inside. Had a savory hint to it.Chicken karaage: usually I find this dish bland, but they did an excellent job flavoring it. The white dipping sauce it came with made it all the more flavorfulTokatsu ramen: so the main reason I got this dish was because it was the most mentioned in yelp. I was a bit surprised since it kind of tasted bland to me, but I'm wondering if it's because the appetizers were stronger in flavor and overpowered the more subtle creamy taste of this Ramen. Mine didn't come with eggs, but the spicy version did and unfortunately the eggs were well boiled (it didn't have that medium soft Ramen egg texture)."", 'I stopped by Tong Sake House for dinner after completing a nearby hike earlier in the afternoon. This is a small restaurant located in a strip mall off Poway Road. At the time, the menu selections were limited to one page and featured starters, ramen, udon, rice bowls, and some sushi rolls. The place was about 3/4 full during my visit so I sat at the bar. I began with an order of takoyaki which came as four octopus fritters covered with benito flakes. The shaved dried tuna was generously applied over the octopus balls. For my entrée, I got a bowl of tonkotsu ramen in mild broth with extra noodles. The soup did seem rather oily as shown in my photo. The prices were as expected, and the food quality was middle of the road so overall it was an average experience.', 'Super friendly staff! Freshly made sushi! Hands down our new favorite sushi restaurant. They give you cute little Korean cookies after with your bill. My kids love it. \xa0Mommy also loves the huge variety of ice creams, especially the coffee ice cream. Great place to eat and they have a good selection of alcohol.', ""Wow, everything here is absolutely delicious! From the moment we walked in we felt welcomed by the kind and inviting staff. We were very hungry and we put in some appetisers immediately. The food service was very quick! The waitstaff was attentive to our needs and checked in to make sure everything tasted okay. And yes, everything was so good! The agedashi tofu is so unique, perfectly crunchy outside with a flavourful sauce with veggies. I also really recome the lemon cilantro roll. It tasted so fresh and you can tell they use really high quality fish in their rolls. Come here for excellent service and top tier food. You won't be disappointed!"", 'We saw this place as we were walking around the little plaza. We were seated right away. It definitely got busy after we sat down. We order truffle fries, shrimp tempura (we had originally order vegetable tempura but they brought it this which was fine), we did one spicy tuna roll, tokoyaki and 2 ramens (spicy seafood and tonkatsu). Everything tasted good and positions were definitely a little on the big side. My only suggestion would be not to overcook the Takoyaki.', 'Tong Sake House is a hidden gem. Here is my breakdown:Pros:-Great service, very friendly- Neat and clean ambiance- Unique selection of food with good varietyCons:-Wish they had longer hours on SaturdaysI really dig the place and the staff is great.', ""Came here last Wed. \xa0Ordered the Biluogi and dish tasted delicious. \xa0Decor and service was also good. \xa0Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was that there was a service fee and didn't see any notice about it."", 'Was craving some Asian noodle soup so tried out a new place. Called in and made a to go order (was told it would be ready in 15min). We got a tempura udon and a spicy seafood ramen. The pros:- the person on the phone was professional, quick to respond and accurate in their time estimate- the soup was still warm when we got home to eat- The tempura udon broth was soft and not over powered by a sharp soy sauce taste which we really liked The cons:- tempura udon came with no tempura... By the time I noticed I was already home and did not want to drive back another 20 min- spicy seafood broth was just spicy with no seafood flavor which is what I was expecting, so if this is what you were hoping for, would not recommend.Hoping some of the cons was due to being unlucky and will want to check in the future how dine in is.']"

I'm updating my review for this loving hut location for 2 reasons. First the 3 star review was legitimately ment for the loving hut on El Cajon Blvd with the garbage menu and the terrible food. After eating from this loving hut through the pandemic I can say, this place has a good menu and some awesome food. Get the burrito. Put some tapatio on that ish and smash through it. Best food coma in Mira Mesa us from Loving Hut. You dont need sleep medication. You don't need to drink. You need the Itis, and the best place to catch some itis is Loving Hut Mira Mesa. - 5 Stars for legit Itis"", '"" I could never go vegan"" said me till I \xa0to try the loving hut and thier vegan dishes Very pleasant experience \xa0I am definitely coming back to try more of your vegan dishes', ""Had a craving for a tempeh reuben - Ki's used to have them but I don't see it on the menu anymore. Looked on here - Loving Hut has one! Gave it a try & ordered for delivery on one of the apps - DELICIOUS. Comes with salad too (or french fries). The salad was nothing special, but the sandwich was big & yummy: sauerkraut, russian dressing, marble rye, big slab of tempeh. I'll get this again!I was also craving veggies, so I ordered another dish; I planned to half and half of each but the sandwich was too good to stop eating! Had the DELIGHT BROCCOLI today for lunch. Big portion, *excellent* Jasmine rice. Lots of broccoli, a bit of mushrooms and onions, some tofu and seitan in a soy-ish sauce. \xa0Super yummy. I would just like more protein compared to the broccoli. But it was plenty to eat for lunch, with some leftover for another meal.They have lots of fried stuff here that I don't need to order - but these were super choices. Thanks Loving Hut!"", 'The food here is great! Even a carnivore like me doesn\'t miss meat at all when eating grub from here. Seriously!So far, it\'s all about the Spicy Cha Cha here for me. It\'s actually not THAT spicy, but it does have a slight kick and is very flavorful. It comes with rice and a yummy faux fish sauce that tastes similar to Vietnamese fish sauce. I could drink that sauce (and then feel guilty about it later). I dig how the proteins are shaped like prawns.Lucky Lemongrass was ok. It\'s a bit hard to rank this high especially when compared to how awesome the Spicy Cha Cha. The protein tasted great when I borrowed the sauce from the Spicy Cha Cha.If I were to write a food love song, the first verse might begin with, ""I love fries. I love burritos."" Ironically, I do not like California Burritos, but the ""Cali Burrito"" from here changed my mind completely. It\'s life-jarringly delicious! Order it then try not to cry about how long you have gone without experiencing this dish.Buffalo Strips are Loving Hut\'s take on boneless wings. They were ok when I ordered them and would prolly pair well with beer and your favorite sporting event...just don\'t make the same mistake I did and eat them with Spicy Cha Cha. Those flavors just will not get along together--your taste buds will thank me for this tip!The ""Fabulous Mongolian"" looks and tastes strikinglysimilar to the late night Mongolian Beef from your local quick-serve Chinese restaurant, complete with the oiliness (an authentic experience that I am still not sure I want in a Vegan/Vegetarian meal).The ""Crispy Rolls"" are simple crispy egg rolls that are easily better than most veggie egg rolls you have had, but still not as amazing as the best meat-filled lumpia. Sorry. Not sorry.I have enjoyed several great to-go dishes from here during the pandemic and I have yet to even try half the menu!I look forward to enjoying even more yummy grub from Loving Hut soon.', 'Hidden gem on the edge of Mira Mesa that you MUST try at least once!! Doesn\'t matter if you\'re Vegan or not, as Loving Hut serves up delicious food anyone will enjoy! Iris is so extremely sweet, and my order was ready when I got there! They have designated parking spots with numbers for curbside pick-up, but you can also order at the restaurant - looks like they have limited outdoor seating as well!The Inzane Burger ($13.00): This was recommended to me and BOY, do I agree with their recommendation!! Such a huge burger filled with so much flavor and delicious ingredients! They use an Impossible Patty and add in Grilled Onions, Grilled Mushrooms, ""Mozzarella Cheese"" and the most decadent Truffle Aioli that just ties everything together so well! I got their Sweet Potato Fries as my side, and they were perfectly crisp! If you like Mushrooms, you\'ll LOVE the Inzane Burger!!McLovin ($7.50): Loving Hut\'s take on McDonald\'s McMuffin - but Vegan! Although you can tell it has Vegan protein substitutes in it, it\'s honestly still so delicious! I personally don\'t like McDonald\'s McMuffins because their Sausage is too salty... but the McLovin I fully support!! They also serve this with a Hashbrown that is identical to McD\'s...but dare I say they made it even crispier here? I do!!! Crispy Rolls (4pc - $7.00): The ingredients listed in this made me curious enough to order. Their Crispy Rolls include carrots, jicama, mung beans, taro, onions and tofu, served with a sweet soy sauce(?) I\'m happy I gave it a try, but I probably would save my stomach for the other two items!Thai Tea Float ($5.00): To all my lactose-intolerant Thai Tea lovers, look no further because Loving Hut is here to save the day!!! Their Thai Tea is perfectly sweetened, and with the addition of their Vegan Vanilla Ice Cream, the Thai Tea Float is a delicious dessert-drink that you\'ll enjoy on summer days to come. I would love to try their Thai Tea by itself next time!Overall, I\'m so extremely grateful to have found this restaurant! Delicious foods at reasonable prices for the portion and of course Vegan substitutes. Hope to come back to try out more of their menu items soon!!', ""If you haven't been to Loving Hut yet, I implore you to just give them a visit! I think you will fall in love. I came here for the first time pre-pandemic, and their vegan protein options were so convincing that I found myself asking my friend if it somehow might be real meat. I'm a huge fan of their sour cream alternative, and will forever be trying to replicate their food. So yummy. So filling. Generous servings. Just gooooooo!"", 'Wow just wow!! So completely impressed this place has the best Vegan Food I have had... The customer service was amazing and the choices of food options was so incredible. Everything was so delicious and flavorful and the ""mock"" sour cream was the best I think I have ever had. I ordered:Loaded Spicy Fries""Steak"" spicy tacosShrimp PlateThe prices were very reasonable. It does take a little bit for the food to come out but it was so fresh and well worth the wait. \xa0I so wish there was one closer to Encinitas but it is worth the drive. Right now they do close the kitchen at like 1:50pm and do not reopen until 4 or 5 due to COVID.', 'Minus 2 stars because we ordered online at 330, at the parking lot at 4, got the order 435. The lady said they will give it to us on the parking lot. I had to go inside cause been waiting more than an hour.I like spicy cha cha the best. Regular customer. I tried for once gluten free, thinking they will just change the breading. I was always curious if what they use inside for chacha. Then i saw it after ordering gluten free chacha. I was disappointed thus minus 1 star.It tasted just like fish balls you buy at asian grocery store. Nothing special. I figured, it is the breading that made it taste so good and without it, this is a 2 star for me. :( the price is hefty but overall, breaded chacha wins. The rest is that i tried is edible but wont order again.Tried crispy roll. Not that great. Mongolian. Okay pass.Lemon grass chicken. Okay once, not again.Spicy chacha- anytime!Spicy chacha gluten free- never again!Buffalo strips- nasty', 'Not very happy about todays takeout order. Today I found a piece of plastic in my Pad Thai. I thought no big deal it problably came off of one of my containers in my order but low and behold none of the containers in my order were broken. I found it very, very odd. So I messaged the manager to let her know and her only response was ""WEIRD"". \xa0I informed her its beyond weird but rather scary because someone could of ate it! In gerneral about this restaurant-The restaurants food is a hit or miss with quality and taste. We have had many great experiences but just as many bad experiences. When you complain to management they make it your fault an order is messed up because of to many modifications to a entree. If you complain as many times as they mess up your orders they won\'t remake them after 5 times. I know no place is ever perfect but they mess up a whole lot. \xa0We only order from here because its the only Vegan Restaurant within 15 miles and my daughter is 100% Vegan-plus its in 4 minutes walking distance. Am I saying to not order from here, NO. But be very cautious on making modifications to anything you order, and make sure you check for missing or incorrectly made menu items.Update: the manager just messaged me asking why didn\'t I mention she offered me a credit. I told her simply because there is no way to compensate for what was found in my food and maybe she should go check their to go containers for any broken ones. So no one else has broken plastic in their food!', ""I'm not Vegan but I still come here for their food. The lucky lemongrass is my favorite you have to try it. They also make you pay over the phone so don't be scared they're not trying to scam you lol. This time I also tried the Amazing chow and it was too flavorful and sweet for me :( That's why I gave it a 4 star and on top of that, it took a bit of a long time for me to get my food when I arrived at the parking lot. Nevertheless, the staff is nice and welcoming. I would definitely recommend this place even if you're not Vegan""]"

To appease the craving gods I immediately whipped out my phone and looked up whatever I could on Yelp. We settled on this place, and I'm glad we did. We showed up on a Sunday at about 11am which is right around the time they were opening. There was only one other set of people in the place. My Wife wanted a strong beer but doesn't like IPA's, the hostess was a genius and suggested that we try mixing a fruity Hefeweizen with an IPA. The hostess let my wife taste a couple of the fruity beers and found the right one. It was an excellent tasting beer.Now about the food....it was great! I got the Hot Mess which was indeed very spicy and delicious. My wife got the standard. We got my son the three chicken tenders combo and some mashed potatoes. My son loved the mashed potatoes, which is awesome because sometimes it's hard to find him something he'll like. The fries are great, and the tenders and biscuit was great. If your looking for an amazing fried chicken sandwich and a great beer look no further."", ""Have had lunch here maybe ten times now....what used to be the biggest tenders I had ever seen has now shrunk in size to a regular size tender. Still very tasty but it's almost half the size it used to be. Just being honest. The sandwich is really delicious as well....I've had the Nashville Hot version of each the tenders and sandwich and each time it was so hot I couldn't eat it all....so I will stick to the regular (not hot) version from now on. The restaurant is always clean and organized with plenty of space to park outside. Good beer selection and they also have a few TVs too. Good spot that I still enjoy despite the tenders shrinking so much."", ""One of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've ever had. \xa0 The Hot Mess was crispy, juicy, filled with flavor and SPICY! \xa0 I like spicy food and am let down with most places going light on the heat factor. \xa0Not here. \xa0This sandwich might make you sweat a little. \xa0I would given five stars, but there is no kids menu and my three year old can't eat a full entree. \xa0 We had to settle for ordering just one chicken tender, a la carte, for $2.50. \xa0 After we settled the bill, I asked for some ranch for my son's tender and they would only give it to me if I paid .50 more. \xa0 Pretty cheap there after the total order of roughly $30. \xa0The fries were cooked and seasoned perfectly."", ""My buddy and I were in there yesterday for dinner. We usually smoke cigars nearby, and this used to be a different restaurant. We decided to give it a try.The two women working there were super nice and helpful (although I don't know why I couldn't make substitutions, but a lot of restaurants are that way). I also wish they would have given me the heads up that six chicken strip meal -- would be way too much food for one person!My buddy tried a variety of things of the menu, and loved them all.I thought $17 was expensive for 6 chicken strips, until I got the meal. The strips were HUGE, and they gave lots and lots of French fries. Both were incredibly delicious.I don't like the cornbread biscuits, so I didn't try them. Gave them to my friend, as well as the pickles (which he claimed were amazing).I felt bad that at dinner time, we were the only customers in the huge dining room. They probably get a lot of business around lunch time, but I hope they can survive. Great value for the money, as it's delicious chicken (and with all the hype over the chicken sandwiches at various fast food style places, I hope people will give them a try)"", 'So I\'ve ate here multiple times before ever since they opened, and this is my review update based on my experience today. My favorite meal I like to order here is the 3 piece chicken tender combo hot mess style. I\'ve always been pretty meh about their fries as they were always over cooked, too crispy or too soggy, and I never finished all of them because they were not worth it. I\'ve also seen other yelpers\' dissatisfaction with the fries as well. But looks like they took in customer feedback because today they were great - thick cut golden fries that were fried perfectly. However, the chicken tenders were a tad bit small, and seems like others who have been coming here for a while noticed this too. The biggest disappointment for me was that they only give one biscuit with the combo meal now. I love their biscuits and when I got sandwiches, I would often trade the fries for biscuits. It\'s misleading too because their menu still says ""biscuits"", indicative of, well, more than one biscuit. It\'s sad to see they\'re cutting cost but if you\'re going to do it, at least update the menu so people don\'t have false expectations!', ""My friend said that I should check out this eatery, so I finally stopped by here \xa0to try their burger combo, since that's what the girl behind the register recommended. I chose the Hot Mess and it came with a buttery toasted potato bun and some house fries. I also got a tender, a corn biscuit, a sweetened jamaica tea, and a couple of cookies as well. They have a nice selection of beers on tap to go with your meal with different daily specials throughout the week.I decided to sit outside since it was such a beautiful, sunny day. I had thought that they gave me the standard chicken burger at first, since it didn't look spicy at all. Boy was I wrong! This definitely had a kick to it, but had the perfect amount of heat- it wasn't too spicy so that you can still enjoy the perfectly dredged chicken breast. I'm also happy with the way they made their fries- I'm not a fan of crinkly fries.The jamaica tea was interesting and refreshing. As for the cookies, they were nice and crisp on the outside, with a chewy texture inside. They were huge and thick too! It took me a couple days to finish them LOL. Since I moved closer to the area, I plan to visit this place more often!"", ""4.5 stars. We've been traveling all over SD to find the BEST hot chicken sandwich. Heres my ranking so far:Ranking:FirebirdsMain Chick Dave's Boss BirdRhythms Chicken and WafflesCorner Chicken East VillageBaba'sCross Street Ali's Crack ShackDon't get me wrong, it's good but competition is fierce. What I liked:- The fries were BOMB- The buns were good- Chicken was big, tender and moist on inside and crispy on outside What I didn't like:- The coleslaw in the sandwich could've been more tangy - The spice they used was just too dry? Like the spice itself wasn't super spicy but they added a lot so that your senses are just overwhelmed with pain. Luckily I have a super high spice tolerance but my friends were dying and did not enjoy it. Although we all agreed that if it wasn't spicy, the original sandwich would've been great. Honestly they have everything else going for them that if they did their spice like Main Chick, then game over"", ""Been meaning to make a run out here and finally got a lunch opportunity. For the most part the food itself was a solid meal. The Parmesan wings in the nickel box was good and the cornbread was still warm and fresh. The takeout process was self explanatory but it was a bit of a wait (about 20 minutes). \xa0I want to say it was likely that the wings took a bit longer to come out compared to maybe a fried chicken type meal. \xa0Another patron was actually a few minutes behind me but got their order about a few minutes earlier then mine. I'd still give this place another shot for their other items if I'm in the area. The customer service was polite also."", ""Been meaning to try this place for sometime and finally stopped in for lunch this afternoon. A rather disappointing experience and I'm thinking that we must have come on an off day given a lot of their other reviews. We both ordered tender boxes one regular and one spicy.Positives:+ The actual chicken was moist and had notes of seasonings/brine especially with notes of rosemary+ The pickles were surprisingly amazing+ The cornbread biscuits were delicious + The house dipping sauce was a great combo of flavor+ The server who brought our order was friendlyNegatives:- The fry on the chicken was too oily for my liking and the breading didn't really adhere to the meat well- My fries were way over cooked and were saturated with oil and were cut off in small pieces (pictured)- The spicy tenders really didn't have much flavor other than heat and I felt they were less tender in texture compared to the regular order- The service at the counter when ordering was unhelpful and less than enthusiasticOverall it wasn't the worst of the chicken shops that we've tried recently by any means but just didn't stack up very well against the best that we've had and and fry on the tenders really sunk this place for us. I don't forsee coming back for sometime, until at least we try the gambit of the other chicken fad list."", ""My friend was raving about this place so we gave it a go for lunch today! I got the hot mess sandwhich. It came with fries and I added a drink. The portions were huge! I highly recommend sharing!! Now, I love spice. The heat was good. Tolerable but you def have to enjoy heat. The sandwhich had a delicious slaw and pickles which went great with the chicken! Now, for the flavor. It isn't a typical Frank's hot wing taste. More like a Cajun spice. I liked it. Didn't love it. But the quality of the meat and everything was so good I will def be back and can't wait to try the regular!""]"

I really enjoyed my cheesesteak meal (fries and drink) and the service here is amazing. The cheesesteak was a good, filling size and had plenty of delicious steak, melty cheese, onions, peppers and mushrooms. Their bread was delicious too. Although it had a lot of goodness inside, it was not messy. Perfect for my picnic at La Jolla beach. Also loved how it came with hot sauce Service was super friendly. Lady taking orders had a great attitude and the employee/cook in the back yelled thank you and bye as we all left. There was a good handful of other guests waiting for take out as well during lunch time rush and it took a good 5 min. Small shop but don't judge a book by it's cover. Right by the Denny's on Miramar rd"", ""We stopped by for the first time over the weekend for lunch and got two standard cheesesteaks; one wit wiz and onions and one with provolone and onions. We also ordered a side of the seasoned fries. While we liked our sandwiches we felt that in each some of the components lacked in flavor. The bread they use got a bit soggy and while the quality of the meat is good it doesn't have a ton of flavor in itself; the cheese dominates the palette on each bite more than I prefer in my cheesesteaks. The way they cook their onions is great however and overall each sandwich did hit the spot well. The fries were also freshly fried and the addition of the garlic salt was a great touch. The service at the counter was also personable and friendly and overall they have a nice variety of sandwiches and fixings on the menu. If you're a fan of Philly Cheesesteaks it is definitely worth a visit."", 'Great food and great service. Awesome Mom and Pop shop. 6 tables inside.

Quality of bread: boringly bland. Quantity of meat: fair/minimally acceptable. Quality of meat: average. Ratio of onions to other veggies (bell peppers, mushrooms): way overkill. Amount of cheese: minimally acceptable. Overall reaction: Average....I've had better, much better, EVEN here in San Diego."", ""Was trying to find a place to get legit Philly cheesesteak closer to my home so saw this place and the reviews seem relatively positive.The sandwich itself was decent but portion is not as much as the other one I go to.

The meats and the cheese were good but just portion was much less than what I am accustomed to.Does it replace my current favorite place in SD to get a philly cheesesteak? nope! But if I feel lazy and don't want to drive so far for one, I would consider coming here again but definitely won't be as full as the meat portions are much less here."", ""Oh my....there's just something about the thought of beef and cheese that just gets the salivary glands goin'...and once they get doing you can't stop them until you satiate them with a proper Philly Cheesesteak.

The cheese wiz also stayed gooey and melty whereas the provolone solidified.- They didn't have the Beyond Philly from their menu on Instagram, which my vegetarian sister was really looking forward to getting- I wished there was more cheese, especially since so much got stuck to the sandwich's wrapping paper- I would probably skip the peppers and mushrooms next time and get a simple cheesesteak with just cheese, steak, and onions"", 'Philadelphia Sandwich Company has been in operation since 1979.\xa0 I never saw it from the street as Denny\'s blocks the view from Miramar Road.\xa0 I noticed it one day as I was going to Denny\'s.Steak sandwich featured tender steak with a mild flavor and Amoroso roll with a complimentary mild flavor.\xa0 I chose the 10"" which was filled with lots of steak and a dinner size meal.\xa0 \xa0 Great tasting steak sandwich.Lady at the counter and the chef in the back were very nice and had my sandwich ready quickly.Wise Honey Bbq chips were crunchy with a delicious sweet bbq flavor.\xa0 Wish I could buy grocery store size bags.Pennsylvania Dutch Birch beer was sweet with that biting root beer flavor.\xa0 One of my favorite root beers.Philadelphia Sandwich Company provides a great Philly eating experience.']"

These are times I would think an owner/worker/assistant would want to go out of their way to make sure the guest enjoys their visit to their establishment.Upon arriving I read the menu that was posted outside on the front of the restaurant, mind you I couldn\'t see it that well b/c they had chairs and tables stacked up right in front of it, but I was looking for ONE specific thing. A Turkey Rueben. I saw they had pastrami but I didn\'t see that it had sauerkraut. Due to them having a sign that says ONE person at a time. I kindly waited for a gentleman to leave before I entered. AS SOON AS I WALKED IN THE DOOR THE OWNER SAID WHAT DO YOU WANT?! I was looking up at the menu to see if any of the sandwiches had sauerkraut as Reubens are known for having it! I asked would it be possible to have a Turkey Reuben, and she said, ""well I guess, but you should just get a turkey sandwich"". I said, my friend did a review for your restaurant and I\'m trying to find the sandwich that she had pictures of...she cut me off and said ""WELL IF YOUR NOT READY TO ORDER STEP OUTSIDE"", ""YOU SHOULD HAVE READ THE MENU BEFORE COMING INSIDE"", I said ""excuse me, I did attempt to read the menu, this is my first time here!"" Any owner I would expect to recommend something rather than continue to be combative w/ me.

She mentioned this joint was often visited by San Marcos students on their way down to Central San Diego. No line or wait on Tuesday morning before lunch.There are a menu and a whiteboard with instructions outside the store, with strict guidelines of 1 person in the store although from the same household. The woman had cautious energy: she told my friend to look a the menu outside if still configuring the order and leave the money on the counter when paying.We didn't realize it was cash only and the woman shared the nearest ATM/credit union a block away. She agreed to make our order of two Spicy Chicken Melts. When we returned, the meals were packaged and ready to go. Spicy Chicken Melt: warm chicken cheese melt with soft toasted quality bread, the shredded chicken chunks had a slight buffalo hint, not spicy at all (probably just some paprika and chili powder). The sandwich was packaged on a plate and saran wrapped causing the sandwich to be soggy/mushy texture from the heat, the meat was following off after every bite. Ordered with a side of jalapeno chips.Overall the meal was a hearty and warm meal for a post-hike in the fall. I felt rushed to order by the woman's nervous energy and quickness to serve up orders; I needed a soup and salad to compliment the textures of the meal.4 stars because I support mom and pop shops, genuine ingredients, and quality. An O-K meal and wouldn't find myself craving it."", 'SUMMARY: \xa0Good sandwiches for my first time, however, price point is somewhat of a contention. \xa0Depends on who you ask!----------------------------------****CASH $$$ ONLY***Man, how I\'ve been pining for this place since I moved in this area and caved in on Thursday for lunch (8/20/20). I am somewhat torn only giving them 3-stars; I was stuck between 3 and 4, even though I am going against the majory-vote here, which is 4+ stars :-(Below are the main highlights for my first encounter with Chez Nous:+ \xa0Bread: \xa0So wonderfully THICC and SOFT. Like clouds. \xa0But edible. \xa0+ Meat: \xa0High quality meat. \xa0This is not your normal deli-style meat. \xa0It\'s REAL MEAT. \xa0Lots of meat in both of our sandwiches.FOOD ORDERED (called-in for pick-up):+ Spicy Chicken Melt (3/5): \xa0The hype was real for this sandwich and the name says it\'s all. It\'s a grilled/pressed sandwich with spicy chicken slathered in their secret spicy sauce. Although the first bite packed a punch, the rest was somewhat of a let-down for the following reasons:(1) Meat was too soaked in sauce for my own liking(2) The chicken was.. dry?Don\'t get me wrong - this sandwich is fantastic and the first of its kind that I\'ve had in my 20+ years of living on this earth. However, the other half of the sandwich was a bit too hard for me to finish mostly due to the meat that I believe was somewhat, possibly?, dry...? Spiciness for this sandwich is a ""mild"" to ""medium,"" albeit some people will have difference spicy level tolerance. \xa0I ordered mine with sourdough bread and, yes, the sourdough bread was delicious. \xa0Note that this is a ""hot"" sandwich and comes with provolone and tomatoes. + Turkey Sandwich: \xa0Bf ordered this for himself in white bread. \xa0The white bread was exceptional - almost like sourdough bread, but it was definitely white bread. \xa0Turkey was also good - it looked/felt and tasted ""real,"" as opposed to deli-style meat. \xa0I requested to add provolone to his sandwich, which had a refined cheese taste, as in, you can tell it was quality cheese and not some cheese you just bought down the street at Vons. \xa0His was also a ""hot"" sandwich.Now, for the major low in my book:- PRICE vs. QUALITY/SIZE: \xa0Price-wise, these were expensive for sandwiches. \xa0Both ran me about $18. \xa0I mean, yes, the sandwiches were big; one can easily share 1 sandwich with someone else (go half-sies), or save the other half of for another round. \xa0However, I am not sure if the other perks of this gourmet-style, ""not your normal"" sandwich (e.g. higher quality and quantity of meat and cheese, cloud-like bread that melts in your mouth), warrants an almost-$10-sandwich a pop. Perhaps it is ""OK"" for the Spicy Chicken Sandwich, but for a Turkey Sandwich...? That, I\'m not sure of.I also understand that we are in a global pandemic that has cost local businesses financial hardships, so maybe I shouldn\'t be criticizing them harshly on price. \xa0On the other hand, this is my first time having food from here so I do not know historically what the price used to be, and that may be beside the point. FINAL THOUGHTS:My boyfriend is a fan but I\'m a bit skeptical. \xa0I think I will in the future, which, at that time, I am hoping I can give them another star and can convince me that their sandwiches are worth the $$$ I am spending...', ""I have loved coming here for over 6 years! This is a family-owned and run place so there are some odd hours and it's usually insanely busy. The chicken and turkey are not sliced like a deli, you get huge chunks; I've seen them carving it up in the back! They are very generous with toppings and I have never been disappointed in a sandwich! Their claim to fame is the Spicy Chicken Melt, but if you're looking for a more traditional 'sub' style sandwich, go for the Oven-Roasted Turkey.I took off one star because they've recently changed their sourdough bread, and I feel it was a downgrade. It used to be one of the best parts of the sandwich, crispy and thick, even with the steam from the spicy chicken melt. Now it's thinner and doesn't have that same crunch on the crust."", 'The food here is stellar. I have yet to try anything that was an absolutely delicious! All of these recipes are unique family recipes. My only complaint would be the lady that takes your money is 90% of the time very rude and the only thing that Keeps people coming back is the food.', ""Based on Yelp recommendations, I ordered the Spicy Chicken Melt, and it was excellent! Soft-toasted bread thick-ish bread, chicken chunks in a chili sauce, and tomatoes and provolone. The right amount of spiciness.Not sure what their doing with regard to Covid-19, but I think they'll have to re-assess their cash only policy."", ""Amazing spicy chicken sandwich and I love the soup!!!! Yes people, they have their own system going, respect it! See they are successful for a reason!!! The woman who runs the place isn't here to play, she recommends great food as well, ask her if you need any help deciding what to get. BRING CASH!!!!!"", ""LOVE Chez Nous! The owners are great and the food is unreal. Best spicy chicken sandwich around and would suggest to anyone who wants a delicious, quality sandwich. We've moved from Scripps Ranch and still make the drive just to get Chez Nous any week day we have off. Can't recommend enough! Just remember to bring cash!""]"

The kalua pig has a nice smoked flavor, and the kalbi is nicely charred.

We had ordered to go via DoorDash so cannot comment on the service but can absolutely talk about the food.FOODCombo Plate - Both of us got the kalbi for one of our proteins. The marinade was very flavorful. The meat was really chewy though but I can imagine it being delicious with the right cut of meat. Korean Chicken - I got this as my second protein and it was still crispy even though we did not get it fresh. The sauce that they threw on top was sweet and slightly tangy. I enjoyed this over the kalbi.Chicken Katsu - The good ole katsu! Again, not crispy because we door dashed it but the flavor was on point. The side of rice was perfectly cooked jasmine rice. The Mac salad was creamy and paired well with the meats. I usually do not like Mac salad but they made it so well here! Yum.My husband and I finally have a go to Hawaiian place when we are craving it.']"

Unfortunately due to the price, quality of food, and time frame from ordering I don\'t think I would return If I was in the area again.This place is busy and I was completely hopeful. I did see that there was 3-4 orders ahead of when I placed my order. Only one person in the front and it appeared one person in the kitchen until about 35 minutes into my wait, then there was 2 people. I looked at the menu on Postmates and had my heart set on a combo and appetizer. However opted to order at the restaurant, only to find out that the combo was a Monday through Friday option only and that is not listed anywhere on the website. I then learned that my entree only came with rice (as I\'ve learned a few restaurants downtown that are upscale do) so all in all adding naan and raita sauce, tip was about $20 for one person. I had high expectations but the Tikka Masala was very oily and while there was flavor the chicken was rubbery or tough and unedible. The naan bread was thin and chewy with an off flavor for being plain. The raita sauce was not for me, it was chunky and strong in herby flavor... I ended up tossing the entire thing. On the way home, I picked up food at my fav Indian restaurant in Mission Valley and ventured home. Did I mention it was about 48 minutes from the time I ordered my food until the time I received my food... while I saw 3-4 tickets before ordering... it was interesting how 7 others received their meal before mine. Yelp has a check-in offer however their soda machine is ""out of order."" I have never been here pre-COVID... but I could imagine the wait being extremely long if they sat people inside the restaurant. Also, as an FYI, leaving rice out at room temperature is extremely harmful as bacteria can start growing, having worked in the restaurant industry and having a degree in Culinary Arts seeing food left out and not being temperature controlled, is a huge turn off. I didnt even touch the rice having knowledge of this... but it is concerning how many others have gotten sick and not even realized it was probably because of this restaurants lack of temp control for to-go orders and pick-up orders.

I ordered via telephone to avoid the grub hub extra charges.. but was surprised when I arrived that the total was higher than what I accounted for on the menu posted online. \xa0We ordered the family feast. \xa0If you order garlic naan, it\'s an extra $1 charge. \xa0If you order two meat curries, it\'s another charge that the online menu doesn\'t seem to account for. \xa0(Online = $26.99 flat). \xa0The variety we sampled included:Chicken Tikka Masala: \xa0the best entree we ordered. very flavorful and creamy. \xa0I wish they offered/ inquired about adding some heat to the dish. Definitely could have tasted a bit better spicy.Lamb Vindaloo: \xa0this was disappointing since vindaloo to me is supposed to automatically have a level of spicy to it. \xa0The lamb was very gamey. \xa0It was okay in general but without that spicy factor, it seemed to be missing something.Chicken Makhani (aka butter chicken): \xa0This was creamy and a great dish for the kids. \xa0Almost sweet. \xa0I didn\'t mind it but hubbie wasn\'t a fan and preferred the Tikka Masala sauce more.Shrimp Karahi: \xa0This was surprisingly tasty. There was a little bit of heat which I appreciated.Good veggies.. shrimp wasn\'t bad.. Samosa Chaat: \xa0This wasn\'t bad. \xa0Chaat style added the garbanzo beans and the equivalent of what I call Indian Salsa Fresca. \xa0I enjoyed the freshness of this dish. \xa0The samosa filling was so-so. kind of small in size and a bit bland to me.Garlic Naan: I wish I knew it was an extra charge. \xa0There was hardly any garlic. \xa0It tasted a bit plain. \xa0It wasn\'t bad but not the best. \xa0I would have opted to save the $2 bucks and get the plain (since that\'s what it tasted like)Rice was generous and fluffy. They did not fail in that regard.Mango Lassi: \xa0Deeeelicious. \xa0Sweet, creamy with the yogurt tang. \xa0I wish they would sell this in a larger size. --------Overall:----------------PROS = good flavor in general for the curries and generous on the proteins. \xa0Portions were.. acceptable (I saw negative reviews about portion size but disagree with those reviews; it wasn\'t mind blowing large.. but it wasn\'t small either. \xa0It was enough.) Lots of options on the menu. Good service and timeliness on the food prep.CONS = needed more spicy factor in all the dishes (and I don\'t usually eat that spicy). I wish they were open about the additional charge re: two proteins and garlic naan on the family meals. \xa0I highly disliked that the to go containers were these flimsy plastic containers. \xa0The hot curry disagreed with the containers making them weak to the high temperature food and made me very concerned about what was leeching into my food since the containers were obviously not made for that type of temperature. Naan could have used more garlic and herbs.TL;DR: \xa0Not bad. \xa0It does it\'s job. \xa0It\'s like ""Bombay Express"" (as Panda Express is to Chinese food). \xa0It\'ll satisfy your Indian food hankering and is probably more popular with ethnic groups who did not grow up with this type of food in their household. \xa0We do recommend giving them a try and would likely return if we had a tikka masala itch.

The price is very reasonable for everything you get, including Chai tea!As for the specialty dishes, our group shared the paneer tikka kebab, chicken tikka kebab, tandoor shrimp, and garlic naan. The dishes had similar flavor, just different proteins. The paneer was very interesting though, it was essentially a cheese kebab with all the spices. I still prefer meat, so my go to was the chicken tikka kebab. We saved room for dessert and tried shahi tukda and some ice cream. I've never had shahi tukda before, but it tasted like bread pudding, so if you're a fan of that, you'll definitely enjoy this. Service was very friendly and attentive.

The only bad thing is that there is no inside dining so you have to eat outside or in your car.', 'Food:We have always liked their milk tea drinks and tofu desserts, definitely a must try. They offer a concise menu, yet there seems like many varieties, perhaps from the plethora of combinations you can do when creating the perfect drink. We recommend the boba milk tea or the taro paste fresh milk tea. Their boba is on the smaller side, has a lot of bounce, and decent chewiness. Their taro paste is bomb though, both in texture and real taro flavor! We also recommend the taro ball tofu pudding - silken tofu and chewy taro balls in a syrup that is not overly sweetened.They have their new ube series out. We tried the ube milk tea, and was not blown away by it unfortunately. The ube tasted more like sweet potato, which has us thinking it might be a Stokes purple potato or Okinawa yam. Service:The staff is friendly. They call out for you and even text you when your order is ready. They uphold COVID guidelines. There can be a line at times. Now, they have a kiosk where you can self order and make sure all the customizations are included. The drinks and desserts also always come out looking pretty. Atmosphere:Take out only, so not much to comment about the mood here. Before the pandemic, the place was busy with people hanging out or working on their computers. But the interior design is nice, they have a large menu to peruse from, and appealing photos of their food desserts and drinks.', ""I only care for the taro balls or the sweet potato balls honestly. If I could have it entirely by itself I would. But it complements well with the drinks and/or the shaved ice with grass jelly. I also find the portion sizes really large and I'm not able to finish it. If the lines weren't so long, and it weren't as pricey I'd definitely come more often."", ""Don't do an online order on the weekend unless you want to fight for your order to be done, have your order done wrong, and receive your order 20 minutes past the estimated time of order completion. I placed an online order on a Sunday at 2pm. The website said it would be done by 210pm. I was shopping nearby so I didn't stop in until 215pm. I figured it would be done since it was 5 minutes past estimated completion.I went to the order pickup area and asked for my order. They asked me if it was an online order and I said yes. They then said they were currently backed up so it would be another 5 minutes. I didn't get my order until 10 minutes later, at 225pm.I'm pretty sure they didn't plan on working on my online order until I asked about it because the shop was filled with people who had walk in orders and the employees were talking to each other about online orders. I ordered two fairly simple milk teas and it took them 25 minutes to get it done.The icing on the cake is that I asked in the online order to not have boba in my tea. I didn't realize until I was long gone from the shop that there was boba in my tea.So pretty much don't ever go here on a weekend unless you don't mind waiting a half hour for your drink and have to fight for your order to be done right.The drinks were good. But they're sugary so it's hard to mess up."", ""Alright so for all the non-asians out there, basically this is a bunch of weird jelly stuff that mostly comes from plants and tastes amazing. I literally don't even know what to compare it to, it's so unique. I guess it would be kind of like boba if it were solid? They do have boba and smoothies as well though. It's a little pricey for a dessert and you will have to wait a bit to get it, but it is very much worth the wait!"", 'I LOVE THEIR MINI TARO BALL MILK TEA! literally my go to every time, never disappoints. staff is very friendly! they are usually very busy so they will give you a number :)', ""I brought my good friend to try my favorite Boba place! Actually not only boba, I love all the things from Meet Fresh. Personally, I love hot tofu pudding or grass jelly with Taro, red bean and peanuts. But I have to say, if you are a boba girl, this place literally has the most authentic Taiwanese boba you can get, since Meet Fresh comes from Taiwan, it's been so popular around the whole Asia for a long time. Also I recommend the egg waffles and mung bean cakes, I just love it!"", ""haven't been to meet fresh in a while but I was in the area so I decided to give them a try and get 2 of their drinks. my mom really likes the desserts here so I usually only get those. i ended up ordering the mango green tea with no toppings, just regular ice (you can't adjust the sugar level for this drink), and I got the fluffy green tea with no toppings as well, with regular sugar. The total came out to be $9.16 and we used the kiosk! we came few minutes after opening so I could tell the teas were really fresh tasting. however in the mango green tea, the mango flavor was really really subtle. I'm not sure if they didn't shake it enough or what but I only started tasting more mango towards the end of the drink. As for the fluffy green tea, the tea itself like I said is tasty. However I wish the cream part was at least a little sweet. I am aware that they make them with no sugar though. Overall, it wasn't bad but not really my favorite. I will come back to try some other drinks next time though :)"", ""The drinks here are always very good! We tried a variety of their drinks and really enjoy their milk tea with pudding and fruit teas. They're all very refreshing and tasty. They have a lot of interesting seasonal drinks and we tried one of the strawberry ones. Definitely recommend it! We also tried two of their desserts: the hot grass jelly and hot almond soup. These are perfect for cold, rainy days. The boba and mini taro balls have the right amount of chewiness. We especially like the grass jelly. \xa0The peanuts were dry peanuts which we can add in the soup which is a bit unusual since we're more used to the pressure cooked soft peanuts in Taiwanese desserts. \xa0Overall, this is a great dessert and drinks place!"", ""I like the precautions Meet Fresh is taking. They have completely blocked off the dining area for the pandemic. Additionally they take Apple Pay which is super useful because I'm tired of my credit card being fondled by everyone in the pandemic. I'm a germaphobe, but I like takeout lol.I order the mango passion fruit green tea which is still good from when I last tried it over a year ago. The tea is def consistent here which I appreciate it.I tried the taro balls in a drink once a while back and those were pretty good. But I haven't tried anything else on the menu to be honest. Recommend checking it out if you're in the Mira Mesa area!""]"

The sandwiches were the bomb and you could really tell there was a sense of passion and pride from all employees, especially the owner.

We were treated so well and will return any and every time we visit San Diego.

They could use better bread and maybe toast it a little. It was kind of mushy. The lettuce looked a bit old with brown edges. \xa0Very little sprouts. However, they put a generous amount of avocado so that was nice. \xa0It was $10 for this simple veggie sandwich but I know the cost of everything has gone up since the pandemic so I can't say much about that.. Overall, it's not bad but they could definitely do better."", ""If you're having a beach day & are looking for some grub, look no further! This shop hit the spot. The sandwiches were made with love, they really don't skimp on avocado, mustard, Jack cheese & Turkey. I'm told the sourdough bread is absolutely divine but I opted for pumpernickel this time around. Even with the pumpernickel bread, I still thought this spot was decent. If you have room, I HIGHLY recommend trying out their flourless oatmeal cookies as well!! It was one of my favorite toppers & would be open to going back just for that next time. Location: it's on the strip with other shops just a short distance from the beach in case you wanted to do takeout & walk towards the beach for a picnic."", 'Used to be great sandwiches, but lately they are taking advantage of their fame and sticking it to the costumers...They are stacking just a bit of meat in the middle and leave you with two inches of tasteless edges... see pics', ""Came here during covid and placed an order online! Everything is take out, but there are plenty of outdoor seatings. I got their famous turkey, jack cheese, and avocado sandwich on wheat bread along with their world famous flourless oatmeal cookie. The sandwich was really delicious and the avocado brought everything together. I could only finish half though since the sandwich was pretty big itself. But if I was really hungry, I'm sure I could have finished both! I also highly recommend getting the flourless oatmeal cookie - it was sweet, salty, chewy, and crispy! After getting the sandwich, I took a stroll to the beach (few minutes away) to eat it! There are a lot of street parking but during peak times, it could get hard."", 'Pretty freaking yummy, I got the turkey avocado one on a sourdough and it tasted very fresh and healthy. I gave it a 4 stars because of the prices- but to be fair, it is right by the beach.', 'Good sandwiches. Good idea to order beforehand and come pick it up. They have fun candy in the store too.', ""Cute little cheese and sandwich shop located directly on Avenida De La Playa in the heart of the shores area of La Jolla. Perfect walking distance from the Shores Hotel. They have a nice assortment of unique bottled soft drinks. The sandwiches there are delicious with choices like fresh roasted turkey and a cheese selection that's better than other delis with choices like havarti and Muenster which is delicious with the fresh turkey btw. There breads are always fresh and they will make your sandwiches any way you would like. They also offer the classic hot sandwiches as well. Like a delicious Reuben. They always have unique and delicious soups as well like lentil with Indian spices. The staff is always very friendly and helpful.
